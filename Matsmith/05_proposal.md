# SERVICE PROPOSAL

**Ad Creative Automation System**

---

**Prepared by:** Small Group
**Prepared for:** Matthew Smith, Matt Smith Consulting
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Proposal valid until:** February 28, 2026

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

This proposal outlines the scope, deliverables, timeline, and investment for a fully managed ad creative automation system — designed specifically for Matt Smith Consulting's Facebook/Meta ads agency serving roofers and home improvement contractors.

Small Group will build, deploy, and continuously manage an automated system that scans your existing ad vault for winning patterns, generates AI-powered ad creative variations at scale, produces daily personal content across multiple platforms, and automates branded client reporting — so Matt can focus on strategy and closing new clients while the system handles creative production, content, and reporting.

---

## 2. OBJECTIVES

- Automate ad creative generation using AI pattern analysis of your existing ad vault
- Produce 200+ ad creative variations per month across all client accounts
- Generate 30+ pieces of personal content per month for Matt's brand presence
- Automate client reporting for all 50 accounts with branded PDF delivery
- Eliminate 15+ hours per week of manual creative and reporting work
- Build a scalable creative infrastructure that grows with your client base
