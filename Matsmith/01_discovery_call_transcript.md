1:34 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  Hey, Matt, how are you, man?

1:36 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Hey, good, thanks. How's it going? Yeah, pretty good. Had a big day today. I'm a bit tired, but I'm good to go.  Where are you from?

1:48 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  From Australia. From Australia. Australia.

1:54 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Australia, okay, okay, got it.

1:56 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  Oh, nice. So, Matt. If you could, you know, before we proceed, if you could explain about yourself, maybe about your business, about your pain points first, then I will proceed with mine.

2:12 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah, sure. So we were six and a half years now, I've been a Facebook ads agency that specializes in helping roofers and home improvement companies.  We have clients in pretty much every state all across America and have done for the whole time we've been in business.  And we, so we do that, we run their ads, we do pretty much everything for them. Most of them are really bad at doing, giving us any content.  So we've always been able to generate and create content and we use, we built out Go High Level. We've been using that for a long time too.  We were one of the first, first users of Go High Level, by the way. So, but yeah. I saw one of the posts you did about how you've been able to automate the meta agency, and I really liked the look of that from the ad creation point, the content creation side of things, like some of the other systems you guys have got too, but that's the one that stuck out to me initially to have a chat about.  Right, right, yeah.

3:24 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  So what things have you tried till now for talking about your most, one of the most main point, which is ad creation, right?  So what things have you tried? For content?

3:38 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Well, we've always been very systematized. So every ad we've ever created, we've stacked and stored and cracked and measured.  And it, and we have a large vault and playbook that we, we use. So we're able to, we were able to.  Get a lot of leverage with a small team servicing, 50 retainer clients is kind of where we cap out.  But with the advancement of AI and stuff like that, I want to be staying with the trends and so creating good quality, like being able to review and scan the performing ads and being able to clone them and recreate them.  And then have the content created really quickly, and scaling in ad accounts, that looked really cool to me.

4:39 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  Got it. Okay. So, if you got the solution, do you have any number that how much, you know, this system will help you in talking about the numbers of revenue, like from what perspective are you looking for, for the current clients?  Or maybe for new clients?

5:02 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  A bit of bias, yeah. The benefit it would provide us is it would save us time.

5:13 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  Okay, okay, got it. Just, okay. So basically, you know, first I'll tell you about myself that currently what I'm doing, currently I'm running an agency in India, right?  And I'm sure that you have gone through my website. We have worked with the different, different industries in the last couple of years.  And I'm also working with the one digital marketing company based out of us, like that is a simole is present on our website.  It's been more than six to seven months, I guess. So since I guess, yeah. And since I'm working with him, right, so we have to a size for him, right, and help him to scale, of course, like, you know, was stuck on 20 to 25 clients.  Just not able to scale, then we have built a customized software for him. And currently we have helped him increase maybe 10 to 15% of revenue.  Right. So the thing is that he was, he's also running a meta ads actually. He's just managing, uh, he's running it for the painters in the U.S.

6:22 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah.

6:24 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  So for sure, you know, in the next meeting, I'll show the perfect demo of that product. Right. We have also, uh, the Salesforce, uh, GHL and hubs for like different, different CRM of the, in that software.  And we have also integrated the methods preview, right? Like you can see all your methods in that software. And we have also plan.  We also make our, you know, next, GDM plans plan for that client as well. Right. And we are also planning that we'll integrate this software, this solution, like ad creation, and.  I think it was great, yeah.

8:05 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Okay.

8:06 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  So you want all complete solution from creating the content, analyzing and that making the code.

8:14 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Got it. Okay.

8:16 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  So, and how frequently do you want to use the, is there any new frequency of it? How did you want to use it?  It also depends on your business model as well, right? Currently you said that you have 50 plus retainer clients.  So, how exactly do want to use it?

8:37 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Well, yeah, we run, we act as if it was the brand doing it versus like, so we use the client's Facebook page and our account to run most of the ads.

8:56 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  Okay.

8:59 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  All right. is that? I'm some marketers just, they use their own ad account, they have their own page, and then they do it that way.  We don't. We act as the brand.

9:13 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So Matthew, sorry to interrupt. I do have a few questions before we start getting into the technical implementation and all these things.  How do you currently operate your business? How do you get your leads? How do you manage them? How do you create the ads?  I just want to understand that. Yeah, sure.

9:32 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  We use Go High Level as our own CRM. In terms of lead gen, we get a lot of, we have a, I create organic content.  I've got a really good system for, but it's all manual. So I post the content every day and I have people reach out.  I then send them my link, my Go High Level link, and they book in that one. Okay. And then when it's not in winter, which will be next month, we run our own ads on Facebook as well.  And just on that, we, so because of winter, because we just kind of have enough by the end of the year, we halve in numbers.  And then as the weather turns, we typically, that's when we go back up to 50.

10:25 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So it's a good time to implement stuff for us at the same So when you say that, when the winter, when the season changes, the numbers, when is, which, which month is it actually?  March is the start of the season.

10:45 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  March and April. Yeah.

10:48 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So we have two to three weeks right now.

10:53 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah, but you know, if it's, it just, that, that's, that's when it does start to ramp up. But if, you know, It's  I'm not putting pressure on timelines or anything, but I've come to you, you know, towards the end, closer to the end of February.  Now, in terms of ad creation, we've sort of alluding to it before, we have every ad we've ever written in our Google Drive.  And we have the industry, we have the date that we wrote it, we know the result, like we've tracked the result, and then we've got, they're all numbered, ad copy, one through, there's hundreds, hundreds and hundreds of proven winners in there.  So we've already got a very large playbook of stuff that's worked well consistently. And then each week I have a team meeting and we tend to come up with stuff in that meeting.  And then, and now we're starting to use AI to help us recreate stuff.

11:59 - Prakarsh Gupta
  And Who have booked that client, and when the client is booked in, now there's another person who's responsible for creating the creatives, managing the entire meta ad panel and all these different ads.  Do you only do meta ads or Google ads is also one of the things that you handle? Nah, it's just meta at the moment, yeah.

13:19 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Okay.

13:20 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So meta ads we are also trying to do, and so we handle all these things, and of course there's going to be a customer relationship and all.  So, are the people who are working, is it just one guy who's managing the customer communication, or is it divided among the all four of you?

13:40 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Um, my wife does that side of it, and we have one person who does the ads.

13:46 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Who runs the ads for your client or for you as well? Yeah, for both.

13:51 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  For both, okay.

13:53 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So that person handles ads of every account, so 50 people he's managing the ads. I think he must have got.  Do own team on the back end then? No. No, okay. That's awesome.

14:06 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  See, I've come up with some, I don't know how this comes across, but I've come up with some of the leading ads in our space and have done for a long time.  So our stuff is super dialed in now. So our media buyer has a huge playbook of stuff that already works and has worked for a long time.  And then we just build on it bit by bit each week. So it's very systematized in that sense, but very manual.

14:41 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So when we say AI and automation and agents and cloud code agents, cloud bot, all these different tools that are already creating a hype.  How do you see it? You know, if we try to implement AI in a system, will that help you get more clients?  Will that help you make it more systemized? it? stammered

16:00 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  When I see the system that you guys have built, it looks very appealing, and I want to see if it can work for us.  Yeah, yeah.

16:07 - Prakarsh Gupta
  I'll just quickly give us an intro. So in the past one year, more than one year, we have worked with almost 35 different businesses, right?  We have worked with content creators, we have worked with agency owners, and we have been handling the entire tech end, tech part of them, right?  Parallel, we have been working with them to build out some solid products. When you see meta ads automation, it's not just one chat GPT or custom GPT that is out there.  It's a lot of big automation that have been chained together so that it can automate one entire process, right?  And for every business, in my experience, every business that I've worked with, the only goal is when you're investing, let's say $10,000 to $15,000 into any AI automation, any AI systems into your business, you're looking to get at least 10x of that amount, right?  That's the only reason you would want to invest. Of course, we want to be up in the race, but what does being in the AI?  So every business that I've worked with, entire goal, we can have short term goals like we want an automation that can do competitive analysis.  We want an automation that can post the entire ads for us. We want an automation that can track which ad is doing bad.  What is wrong with it and can upgrade it. There are a lot of systems and I think you already know the playbook, right?  But what is the long term goal? Our long term goal can be that we want to handle more number of clients, or we want to automate your content site.  you're already running content on your Facebook page. Do you want to automate that? Or when we say, you know, there's another person who's handling the customer, your wife is handling the customer communication.  And that is a very big hassle in a lot of businesses. Handling 50 clients on text or on email is a very big hassle.  I know because I've been working with a lot of businesses myself. Tushar has been doing the same as well.  So the reason I'm asking you this is all So The systems that I have built over the past one year, the smart ads automation that you saw, and all these things, it only depends on what exactly do you want out of it?

18:11 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Right?

18:11 - Prakarsh Gupta
  If you want to automate our business end of it, that is, if any, any client, let's say I have Matthew as my client who's, who wants 10 different ads running on their business every single month.  And I want to manage that. If that is my problem statement, then I will build this entire system that as soon as the client is there, we want to understand the business.  We want to understand the entire tonality, your, their ICP, all these different details and have an entire book of knowledge that what does business do?  Then we want another system that can use this knowledge, can create right creatives for them that you already have.  You have an experience. You have been doing this business for 6.5 years. You know, what ads work, what I do not work.  So you want, we want to use that knowledge as well. And we want. to have the customer information to create these ad creatives and post it automatically, right?  It's not just photos. There is all the short form videos. There is textual content. There is repost comment engagement or a lot of different things are out in the market.  So when we say we want to automate our agency, we want to automate our ads agency. We still need a few people who's just taking a look at it.  First, we want people who can build the system. Then we want people who can understand the system and keep correcting it over a period of time.  You have been doing this business for six years. You know, every single week, every single month, you have learned something new and you have corrected yourself.  That's why you are able to manage 50 people in your current four people team. So what I want to understand is when we say, Hey, Tushar, Hey, Prakash, we want to automate our agency.  What exactly do we want to do we want to lead generation automation? That is, that is also that we have built.  Do we want to automate how we are creating ads for a business? Again, the system that I told you about, we have that built, but as soon as I understand your problem statement, my focus is going to be going into the nitty gritties of how you work and create the system that is optimal for you, not for anyone else.  If it is optimal for you, then it is going to be very easy for you to use it. But if I may, if I create a generalized product that you, that I can create a SaaS product for you, and then you can simply say that the Prakash just gave it to me and you may not use it.  It may not give you that results. So again, just coming back to the question now, what do you see that?  What problem is the first problem that you want to implement in your business using AI?

20:47 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  We dropped out a bit at the end there. What was the, could you repeat the question?

20:52 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Yeah, all I'm saying is now that you, we understand what this AI system and all these things have been been doing for different people.  So when that is the problem statement, I would want to understand what do you do in your business? How are you contributing?  And then I will try to suggest you, how can we get you only contribute very less amount of time so that you just only to have to take the overview.  Yeah, can you answer that?

22:36 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  What was it? What do I do? And what are the things that take up the most time? Correct. Yeah, okay.  Creating the content and posting and doing all that manually. Well, that's time consuming and I haven't done it well for a while, but how My  Because I've created so much from the past, I've got a big, big vault that I can draw on, but it's definitely time consuming.  It's one of the most important things in the business. Ad strategy would be the thing that takes the most brain power.  And then that, and something that I, and a problem that I've never been able to solve is, is content creation for the clients.  Hmm.

23:36 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Okay. So when we said content creation on your end, I would, so there are three questions that three things that you mentioned, content creation for you, content creation for your clients.  And the third one was, uh, creating the strategy for each and every client, right?

23:52 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  And report and reporting for client reporting. We, we don't have much in place. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

24:00 - Prakarsh Gupta
  I think that's a very good thing that we can start with. So when we say content creation for you, how are you currently creating content?  See, I'm a very curious guy. I just like to keep asking a lot of questions. So that I think everything about you, and then I'm gonna drop you an amazing agent that can do everything for you.

24:22 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  So the way, my system and model for content creation, I have, I do a variety of different things that all relate into four or five different categories.  The first one is sharing stuff about me in my personal life and my family, showing us having fun, going on adventures, like so I'm very relatable.  I do a little bit on motivation and inspiration. I have a pretty cool story, like a pretty cool comeback story.  and I share stuff about that. .

26:00 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Creating, or see, I think testimonial is something that can be easily taken care of. Yeah. Post this testimonial organization, we get on different platforms, on different.  When we say putting videos for you, uh, what do you want someone to handle these things? For example, as soon as you are, sorry.  So are you recording your own videos or is it something like, uh, you have some pipeline that you use and that I can also use to create an automated content for you?  Hmm.

26:35 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  One thing I didn't clarify. So with the content, it is a mix too, of some, some are videos and some, uh, uh, short written things.  Some are memes, some, uh, long form written content with, with images. Um, so it is a variety of all.  Um, and then in terms of the video we've had, uh, Um, um, We've had video content creation. What's, I can't even remember, I'm a bit tired, that particular role.  We've had people come on and create reels and chop things up and turn it into videos for us. We've had a podcast that was reasonably successful where reels were created out of that.  I hired a video content agency and we used to do short form videos. So I've got a big vault of stuff like that.  And then every now and again, I'll just record stuff straight from my phone and post it.

27:36 - Prakarsh Gupta
  I think this is a good clarity. And what I would ask you to do is probably Tushar if you can create a group for us and where Matthew can just drop in the social media.  I can just go through and analyze what he's trying to do so that I can come up with the, in the next call, I can come up with the right strategy for M13.  think this is... That's the agent that we're going to build, and this is how it's going to build life, right?  That is going to solve the first part. The second part is strategies for your clients, right? Now, can you deep dive into how you build strategies for your clients?  What is your playbook?

28:20 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  So the system that I use and the strategy for the clients, it has some similarity to what I just shared with you, but it's more direct around their business.  But we utilize a lot of personal images, sharing images and stuff or videos of them and their family, but we tie that into an ad.  So the ads that we use, we have ads that are more personal, that are, they're not a direct response ads.  It just shows who they are, what they do, why people should reach out to them. We have ads that are.  Very direct. have a really hot offer in them. We have ads that tell great stories about pain points and frustrations.  We have testimonials and that I turn that into the system, the ad system for the clients. That is pretty similar to what I do, but far more branded to their, to their business.  Like I can share one of hilarious, crazy stuff and can get away with it because our brand is about having fun and drinking from the skulls of your enemies and all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff.  Whereas I can't really do that, but there is some similarity and we make it very relatable type ads. We have ads that have great offers in them.  We have ads that are testimonial and result based, and we have ads that tell great stories or share content.  good case studies and stuff like that. Got it.

29:57 - Prakarsh Gupta
  And do you have any documented method of Of how you are building this strategy or whatever you share with the clients and what you want from the clients and all these things.

30:13 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  We just ask, we just show them the images and videos that we need from them. We just have a video that we send them.  And so this is the stuff that's working. Get us that and we'll take care of the rest. And then we also use a bit of Arcad's AI to do some like talking head videos because most of our, like they're all tradies or roofers, home improvement guys.  They don't really like recording videos. Fun fact. we can get content from their Facebook page and stuff like that.  Yeah. Just a fun fact.

30:51 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Actually, when you mentioned Arcad's. So Arcad's have, uh, they have sponsored a few of my YouTube videos, I create YouTube content and I YouTube, I.  Create YouTube content related to AI automation and how people businesses can, you know, use different app systems and all these things.  So our guides reached out to me, uh, Roman, Roman is the co-founder of it. I am a decent friend of him and, uh, we had a good chart there.  And then, then I got to know about his platform and how the quality of videos that he's creating, that is compared to a agent.  think that's phenomenal. The reality is very much there. Of course, when you use 11 labs voice and all these things, it just creates your existence.  So I've created automations that can create these head talking videos for different automations. So I think that we can leverage.  So I think I'm able to get some picture that, you know, I can use these and these pieces to stitch together the system for you.  And, uh, yeah, in this, this part, I would want a few more things just to get clarity on the second part, the video that you sent that, you know, you want XYZ type of video and you want XYZ.  What of testimonials and images so that you can start creating the content for them. I would want that if you can send me that video, what all things are you asking for them and example, any example business that have shared you these things.  I just want to see the output that you have been bringing so that I am easily able to replicate that.  If that makes sense. Sure. I'll just write that down.

32:26 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah. Tushar. Yeah.

32:28 - Prakarsh Gupta
  As soon as Tushar can create a group, I can quickly send you what all things I need, I need from you.  And then you send me all these things. Now, the third question that you have, that was creating content, automating the content strategies, content pipeline for your clients as well.  So right now, I think you've answered, you've already given me great insight on how you're creating the strategy. When you talk about creating the content, who is creating the content for your clients right now?

32:59 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  All Yeah, we pretty much do. I say pretty much like the way that we've been able to do it and still get good results is we go to their Facebook, their personal Facebook page, and we can normally get enough personal images of them or them and their wife and their kids and stuff to make it work for a while.  We then ask them to give us stuff just like that. On their business Facebook page, they've normally got some drone footage or they've had some people make some videos in the past.  And so we've normally got a good starting point. And then we just show them this stuff is what's working.  And then we will then create some talking head videos or we'll create some still images with banners. We've got a whole, everything we've ever done that's worked, we have tracked and measured in a content library as well.  So we've got a lot of pre-made stuff that we continue to use. next And Got it.

34:03 - Prakarsh Gupta
  I think, yeah, if you have all these things, this is quite beneficial. And, uh, so who is the person?  Is it the Philippines guy who's creating the textual copy and all the copy? Or is it someone else who's all the contract?

34:21 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. She, she, she essentially implements the strategy. Okay. From Philippines. Is that her? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. Great.

34:33 - Prakarsh Gupta
  And, uh, let's say I'm a client of yours, right? Uh, what are the offers that you allow me so that I can purchase your services?  To sign up with us?

34:46 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah.

34:47 - Prakarsh Gupta
  What is the package?

34:49 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  You might like this. There's no real offer. Yeah. Sorry. Because it's so heavily based on people come to us because of the results  We've been able to generate, but we'll put a minimum in there to make sure that they're comfortable and confident.  We have like a 3K retainer, and if we don't get them a certain number of leads, we won't charge them the next month until we do.  That's as big as the offer go. We've never had to because we've got really good positioning. Yeah.

35:30 - Prakarsh Gupta
  I think that's, I understand the entire point of it, because that is something that we're also trying, we are also doing, even though we did not have to do it anytime.  Thing is when we work with lead generation automation and all these things, even we say that we're going to get you X number of leads by the end of two months.  And if you're not able to do it, we are not going to charge 20% of the entire amount. And the reason is because we are so confident about the strategies, because we have understood the business once, in and out.  Once we have understood it, now we. We know that what works in the lead generation business, what does not.  And that's why you're able to put it. although even we haven't been able to, uh, you know, uh, not take that 20% because we are able to generate the results.  So that is a good part to begin with. Now, again, I think I'm just going to go back to a few hypothetical questions.  When we say that, let's say you gave me these three problems. If I am able to save you enough, this, this amount of effort, I'm able to automate these things, you get enough time, right?  What does that mean to you in the business terms? You know, are you going to be looking into expanding the business?  Are you going to be focusing on the family or do you want, you know, uh, what result that does that bring you by saving your time?

36:46 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Um, yeah, I would most likely reinvest the time into business, uh, strategy, growth. We also have a property business.  It's turned into a business.

38:00 - Prakarsh Gupta
  No, not really.

38:04 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Okay.

38:06 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Okay, Tushar, do you have anything?

38:10 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  Nothing, nothing, nothing from Smith. Perfect.

38:14 - Prakarsh Gupta
  What is your business called, by the way? Mattsmithconsulting.

38:18 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Pretty straightforward. Yeah. Okay.

38:36 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Alright, so Tushar, do you have Matthew's WhatsApp number so that we can create the group?

38:42 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  No, like, we can actually.

38:44 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Yeah, Matthew, if you can just drop your WhatsApp number here, and then we can bring this conversation on text.  I can share you all the details, what I want. And, yeah.

38:58 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

39:04 - Prakarsh Gupta
  And what do you think that if I say, you know, let's have, I want to have a call with you so that I can create the right strategy for your system, what is the best time as well as a date that should work?

  We, I can do this time with you guys. So we kind of, we kind of do, we're kind of on the opposite ends of time zones with, you're doing like the start of the American day going into the mid morning, whereas I do the early afternoon through to the evening, but I can do these times because everyone's in bed.

39:47 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So is it Thursday for you or is it Friday?

39:51 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  It is Thursday, 9, 10 PM. Okay, Thursday, 10 PM. I normally do like 5 AM Australian through to...

40:06 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So how about we can connect probably in two days. We can connect on Saturday, same time. What do you think, Tushar?  Are you available?

40:19 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)
  Yeah, perfect. So let's connect at the same time, Saturday.

40:23 - Prakarsh Gupta
  And I tell them, let me prepare up the right strategies for you. And then I can give you the right system.  What all exactly do you need in a business to get ahead? I don't want you to just be similar to other agencies who are doing AI.  I wanted to get ahead of it. plan out that. And then I can show you all the system that we have already built so that you have an idea what we have on the plate as well.  Right? Yeah.

40:49 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah, I have a big interest in a good handful of what I saw on the website, but I thought we'd go the way we had tonight.  out, which is focus on a few things. And then go from there, yeah. What other thing are you interested in?  Well, I loved the LinkedIn automation, posting content, lead generation, and the same. I see that in cold email or coldish warm email, lead gen system as the same sort of thing.  I loved that. That looked great. I loved the Instagram system. That looked pretty cool too. There was the meta one.  We talked about content creation. What else? You guys have some really cool stuff actually. I can't remember. Yeah, let me have a look.  screen. Let me have a Yeah. Okay, so up Yeah.

41:57 - Prakarsh Gupta
  Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

42:01 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Oh, the recruitment, I liked the look of that, HR agent, yeah, that was badass, and the SEO blog writer, so I get asked, we get asked all the time to implement more stuff for our clients, and we have a good, because what we do is very seasonal, like I sort of explained at the start, our business drops in half, and by the end of the year, we're really happy about that, because we can rest and recuperate and stuff like that, but point being, I have a good number, a broad number of former clients who have mostly been very happy with us, there's always a few that aren't, and I get hit up all the time for different things and different projects and stuff like that, and I say no to a lot, because I can't deliver on it, I just wouldn't, but that's a long-winded.  Good way of saying I'm getting asked for clients to do, like, how to get them found through the LLMs, how to get found on ChatGPT, to be recommended on ChatGPT and stuff like that.  So I see the AI system that you've built there as being some good crossover for that. Yeah.

43:25 - Prakarsh Gupta
  It is actually the exact thing that you're looking for, I know. And, uh, I think that, uh, since you're interested in all these things, I would love to have a longer call with you that I can show you each one of the systems, because if you're liking it, just by looking at the post, I know you're going to love it as soon as I drop in the entire system and how it works.  So I'm excited for that. But if you can list down the right things that you look interested in, let's say, if you are interested in this, your blog writer or the HR agent part.  And I can probably prepare everything up for you in the next one. So. So let me know what other, what other systems that are you interested in immediately because, yeah, while developing these things, you know, as I mentioned, you know, I've worked with different businesses.  So every business has a different type of problem. Every business has a different type of way of working. So my role is just to understand what you want, how you do it.  And then me and Tushar and the entire team, we have a team of almost 25 people here. And we, we have to crack down the right systems for them.  And how, what is the NDS part? So that is something that I will have to do on the back end.

44:41 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
  Yeah, cool. Love that. Awesome, Arani. Yeah, we can do that for sure. Perfect.

44:47 - Prakarsh Gupta
  So let's connect on Saturday, same time, and then I'll have a better pitch way. All right. Right. All right.

44:55 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)
