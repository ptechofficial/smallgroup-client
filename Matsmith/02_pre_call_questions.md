|------|-------------------|
| **Business** | Matt Smith Consulting — Facebook ads agency for roofers & home improvement, 6.5 years, US-wide |
| **Team** | ~4 people: Matt (strategy/content), wife (client comms), 1 media buyer (runs all ads), 1 Philippines VA (implements ad strategy) |
| **Clients** | ~50 retainer clients at peak, seasonal — drops ~50% in winter, ramps back up March/April |
| **Pricing (his)** | $3K/month retainer per client, performance guarantee (no charge if leads underdeliver) |
| **Tools** | Go High Level (CRM + booking), Google Drive (ad vault), Meta Ads, Arcads AI (talking head videos) |
| **Lead Gen (his own)** | Daily organic content → inbound inquiries → GHL booking link. Also runs own Facebook ads outside winter. |
| **Content (his own)** | Mix of personal/family, motivation, testimonials, memes, short & long form, video reels. All manual. |
| **Content (for clients)** | Pull from client Facebook pages, request personal photos/videos, create banners/stills, use Arcads for talking heads. VA implements. |

## Questions to Ask Matthew

### A. Numbers & Revenue (Critical for ROI framing)

1. **What's your total monthly revenue at peak (50 clients)?** We know each client is ~$3K/month, so roughly $150K/month — can you confirm?

2. **What's your average client lifetime?** How many months does a typical roofer stay with you? (Needed to calculate LTV and frame our cost against it.)

3. **What's your current monthly ad spend on your own lead gen?** When you're running your own Facebook ads outside of winter, what's the typical budget?

4. **What's your current cost structure?** Rough monthly cost for your team — media buyer, Philippines VA, any contractors? (Helps us frame automation savings.)

5. **How many new clients do you typically onboard per month during peak season?** And what's your close rate from discovery call to signed retainer?

---

### B. Scope & Priority (Critical for proposal)

6. **Rank your top 3 priorities from this list:**
   - [ ] Automating your own content creation & posting
   - [ ] Automating ad creative generation for clients
   - [ ] Client reporting dashboard/automation
   - [ ] LinkedIn outreach / lead gen for your agency
   - [ ] Cold email / warm email lead gen
   - [ ] SEO blog writing for clients
   - [ ] HR/recruitment agent
   - [ ] LLM visibility (getting clients found on ChatGPT)

7. **For ad creative automation specifically — how many new ad variations do you create per client per month?** (e.g., 4 new creatives/month? 10? Just refreshes of existing winners?)

8. **For your own content — what's the target posting frequency?** Daily across which platforms? (Facebook only? LinkedIn too? Instagram?)

9. **For client reporting — what do your clients currently receive?** Monthly report? Weekly? Nothing? What metrics do they care about most?

---

### C. Budget & Investment (Critical for pricing)

10. **Do you have a budget range in mind for AI/automation systems?** (Not a commitment — just helps us right-size the proposal. One-time build vs. ongoing managed service.)

11. **Would you prefer to start with one system and expand, or implement multiple systems at once?** (Phase 1 vs. full rollout.)

12. **Are you the sole decision-maker, or does your wife / business partner need to sign off?** Should she be on the next call?

---

### D. Technical & Access (Critical for system design)

13. **Can you share access to your Google Drive ad vault?** (Or a sample — we need to understand the structure to build an AI that can scan, categorize, and clone winning ads.)

14. **Can you share the onboarding video you send to new clients?** (The one where you show them what content/images/videos you need from them.)

15. **Can you share 2-3 example client ad accounts or campaigns?** (Doesn't need to be live access — screenshots of the ad manager showing your campaign structure, naming conventions, and performance metrics work.)

16. **What does your Go High Level setup look like?** Pipelines, automations, sequences — are you using it beyond CRM + booking? (Determines integration complexity.)

17. **Do you use Meta Business Manager with shared access, or individual ad accounts per client?** (Affects how we build the automation.)

---

### E. Content Assets (Promised from Call 1)

18. **Your social media profiles** — Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram links so we can analyze your current content style and frequency.

19. **Your content categories/pillars breakdown** — You mentioned 4-5 categories (personal/family, motivation, testimonials, etc.). Can you list all of them with a rough % split?

20. **Sample winning ads** — 5-10 of your best-performing ads from the vault (copy + creative) so we can train the AI on your proven style.

---

### F. Growth Vision (For Phase 2 seeding)

21. **If time and capacity weren't a constraint, how many clients would you want to manage?** 75? 100? Or is 50 the sweet spot and you'd rather increase revenue per client?

22. **You mentioned clients asking you for SEO, LLM visibility, and other services. How many of these requests do you get per month?** (Helps us size the upsell opportunity.)

23. **You mentioned a property business — is that something you'd eventually want automation for too, or is it separate?**
