## OPENING (2-3 minutes)

**Build rapport, set the agenda, plant the frame.**

> "Hey Matthew, good to see you again. Thanks for making the time — I know you're deep in it with 50 accounts running, so I want to make sure this is valuable for you."

> "So last time we talked, you walked me through the agency, the ad vault, how your team operates, and some of the bottlenecks you're hitting — especially on the content side. Since then, my team and I went deep on this. We actually already built a very similar system for another Meta ads agency, so we had a real head start. I'm excited to show you what we put together."

> "Here's what I want to cover today: First, I'll recap what I heard from you to make sure I didn't miss anything. Then I'll walk you through the three-part system we've designed — the AI ad creative engine, your personal content automation, and automated client reporting. Then we'll talk numbers and next steps. Sound good?"

**Wait for confirmation. If he wants to add something, let him.**

> "Before I dive in — has anything changed since we last spoke? Any new priorities, client changes, anything I should know about?"

---

## RECAP & VALIDATION (3-5 minutes)

**Show him you listened. Make him feel heard.**

> "So here's what I took away from our first conversation. You've been running Matt Smith Consulting for six and a half years — Facebook and Meta ads for roofers and home improvement companies across the US. You've got about 50 clients on retainer at $3K a month each, with a lean team of four people — you on strategy and content, your wife handling client comms, one media buyer running all 50 accounts solo, and a VA in the Philippines implementing ad strategy."

> "You told me your system is — and I'm using your exact words — 'very systematized but very manual.' You've got hundreds and hundreds of proven winners in your Google Drive vault, tracked by industry, date, and result. You said you're running some of the leading ads in your space. The machine works. But the manual parts are killing your capacity."

> "The big one you flagged was client content creation. You called it 'a problem I've never been able to solve.' Right now you're pulling from client Facebook pages, requesting video content, creating banners and stills, using Arcads for talking heads — but it's all manual. Your VA implements, but the creative bottleneck is real."

> "On top of that, your own personal content — the daily organic stuff that drives your inbound leads — you're creating and posting all of that manually. And on the reporting side, you said you 'don't have much in place' for client reporting."

> "The goal is to save time on the stuff that's working, automate the repetitive creative work, and free up your brain power for ad strategy — which is where you actually move the needle."

> "Did I miss anything? Anything you'd add or change?"

**Let him respond. Take notes on anything new. Then transition:**

> "Perfect. So based on all of that, here's what we put together..."

---

## THE STRATEGY PRESENTATION (10-15 minutes)

### Pillar 1: AI Ad Creative Engine

**This is the big one. His #1 pain point. Lead with his words.**

> "Let's start with the thing you told me has been 'a problem I've never been able to solve' — creating ad content for clients at scale."

> "Right now, the process works but it's all manual. You pull from client pages, request content, create variations, your VA implements. And you've got this incredible asset sitting in Google Drive — hundreds and hundreds of proven winners tracked by industry, date, and result. You said you're 'super dialed in now' with some of the leading ads in your space. That vault is gold."

> "Here's what we build. An AI creative engine that plugs directly into your ad vault. The system scans your proven winners — the copy, the hooks, the structures, the angles — and learns what works. Then it generates new variations at scale. Fresh ad copy that follows the same patterns that already win for you, but with new angles, new hooks, new takes."

> "We're talking about your four categories — personal and relatable, direct response with a hot offer, pain point stories, and testimonial-based ads — all being generated automatically based on the patterns in your vault. The AI doesn't guess. It clones what's already working and creates variations you can test."

> "And for the visual side — banners, stills, creative assets — the system pulls from client content, generates variations, and formats them ready for your VA to implement. Instead of your team spending hours building each creative from scratch, you're reviewing and approving AI-generated options."

> "Think about it — you said creating content is one of the most important things in the business, but it's also the biggest bottleneck. What if your team could generate in 30 minutes what currently takes a full day? And the quality stays high because it's all trained on your proven winners — not generic templates."

> "You told me you want 'the stuff that's working — get us that and we'll take care of the rest.' That's exactly what this does."

---

### Pillar 2: Personal Content Automation

**This is where we drop the proof.**

> "Pillar two is your own content — the daily organic stuff that drives your inbound leads."

> "Right now, you're 'creating the content and posting and doing all that manually.' You've got a great mix — personal and family content, your comeback story, testimonials, memes, short and long form, video reels. It works. It drives inbound. But it eats your time every single day."

> "What we build is a content automation system for your personal brand. We analyze your existing content — what's performed well, what gets engagement, what drives bookings — and the system generates a content calendar with ready-to-post content. Captions, hooks, hashtags, posting schedule. You review, approve, and it goes out automatically."

> "You said you want to be 'staying with the trends.' The system monitors what's working in your space — what other agency owners are posting, what's getting traction in the roofing and home improvement niche — and incorporates those trends into your content pipeline."

> "Now here's why I'm confident this works. This isn't a proposal I'm reading off a page. We already built this exact type of system for another Meta ads agency. They run Facebook ads for painters in the US — similar model to yours, 20 to 25 clients. We built them an ad creative automation system and it helped them scale their output and increase revenue 10 to 15 percent. The engine already exists. For your business, we customize it to your vault, your categories, your clients' industries. But the system? It's built. It's running."

**Pause. Let that land.**

> "So instead of spending an hour or two every day on your own content, you're spending 15 minutes reviewing what the system generated. That time goes back to ad strategy — which is where your brain power actually makes money."

---

### Pillar 3: Client Reporting System

> "The third piece is something you said you 'don't have much in place' for — client reporting."

> "Right now, with 50 clients on retainer, your wife is handling client comms, but there's no automated reporting. That means either clients are asking for updates and your team is scrambling, or they're not getting visibility into results at all."

> "What we build is an automated reporting system that pulls data from your Meta ad accounts and generates weekly client reports. Performance metrics, spend, results, trends — formatted and sent automatically. Every client, every week, no manual work."

> "This does two things. First, it saves your wife hours every week on client communication — they're getting proactive updates instead of asking questions. Second, and this is the bigger play — clients who see their results regularly stay longer. They renew because they can see the value. That's especially important during your winter dip when you're trying to retain as many of those 50 accounts as possible."

> "You're running 50 accounts. Even at 15 minutes per report manually, that's over 12 hours a week just on reporting. The system does it in seconds."

---

## PHASE 2 TEASE (3 minutes)

**Don't sell this. Just plant the seed.**

> "Now, everything I just walked you through is Phase 1 — the ad creative engine, your personal content, and client reporting. That's what we build and launch in the first four weeks."

> "But I want to give you a quick look at where this can go. You mentioned a few things on our first call — LinkedIn automation for a different lead channel, cold email outreach, potentially building out Instagram, even an HR recruitment agent for finding talent. There's also SEO and blog content that could drive organic leads to your agency long-term."

> "We're not scoping or pricing any of that right now. I just want you to see that the infrastructure we're building in Phase 1 — the AI training, the automations, the integrations — that becomes the foundation for everything else. Once the core system is running, expanding into those areas is straightforward. But first things first — let's get the creative engine and reporting live."

---

## PRICING PRESENTATION (5 minutes)

**Timeline first. Then value stack. Then price.**

> "So that's the full system — three pillars working together. AI ad creative generation trained on your vault, personal content automation, and automated client reporting for all 50 accounts. Let me talk about what it takes to get this running."

### Timeline

> "We can have this fully live in four weeks. Here's the breakdown:"

> "Week 1 — Infrastructure. We ingest your entire ad vault into the AI system, train the models on your proven winners, and set up all the integrations with Go High Level and your Meta accounts."

> "Week 2 — Build. We construct the creative pipeline, set up your personal content calendar, and build out the reporting templates for your clients."

> "Week 3 — Go Live. First AI-generated creatives come out for your team to review, your personal content starts posting, and we run test reports across a handful of accounts."

> "Week 4 — Full Volume. All clients are active in the reporting system, ad creatives are flowing at scale, and your personal content is running on autopilot."

> "That means if we start now, you're fully operational before peak season hits in March and April. You ramp into your busiest months with the system already running — not scrambling to build it while you're onboarding new clients."

### Value Stack

> "Here's everything you're getting: the AI ad creative engine trained on your hundreds of proven winners. Automated creative generation across all four of your ad categories. Personal content automation for your daily organic posts. Automated weekly reports for all 50 client accounts. Full integration with Go High Level and your Meta ad accounts. And ongoing optimization as we learn what the AI generates best."

### Tool Costs

> "Before I get to our fee, let me cover tool costs. There are third-party tools the system runs on — AI APIs, scheduling tools, reporting infrastructure. That runs about $160 a month. These are in your name, you own the accounts, and you'd have these regardless of whether you work with us or not."

### Two Options

> "There are two ways to work with us."

### Option 1 — One-Time Build

> "Option one is a one-time build. We design and build the entire system — the creative engine, the content automation, the reporting infrastructure — train it on your vault, and hand it off to you. Your team runs it. That's $7,500 one-time, and it includes two weeks of support after handoff."

> "The tradeoff is your team would need to manage and optimize the system ongoing. If the AI needs retraining, if new ad categories emerge, if something breaks — that's on your side. And you'd probably need your VA spending 5 to 10 hours a week managing the outputs."

### Option 2 — Fully Managed (Recommend this)

> "Option two — and this is what I'd recommend — is fully managed. We build everything AND we run it for you. Every week, my team is monitoring the creative output, optimizing the AI based on which ads are performing, managing your content calendar, ensuring reports go out, and adjusting the system as your client roster changes."

> "That's $2,500 a month, 6-month commitment. Month 1 is split — $1,250 upfront and $1,250 at the end of the month. Plus the $160 a month in tool costs."

### The ROI Frame

> "Let me put this in context. Each of your clients pays $3,000 a month. If the content automation helps you retain even one additional client through the winter — one client who would have churned because they weren't seeing reports or felt like things were stale — that one client covers the entire monthly cost and then some."

> "Or look at it from the inbound side. Your personal content drives leads. If automating your content frees up your time and keeps you posting consistently — and that consistency brings in even one new client — that's $3,000 a month in new revenue against a $2,500 investment."

> "Compare it to hiring. If you hired someone to do what this system does — creative generation, content management, reporting for 50 accounts — you're looking at $4,000 a month minimum. Probably more. And they still need training, management, and months to ramp up. The system is live in four weeks."

> "At $2,500 a month, this is less than one client's retainer. And it touches every client you have."

**SILENCE after stating the ROI. Do not fill the gap. Let him process.**

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "That's expensive"

> "I hear you. Let me frame it this way — you've got 50 clients at $3K each. That's $150K a month in revenue. We're talking about $2,500 a month to automate the creative bottleneck you've been trying to solve for six and a half years. That's less than 2% of your revenue."

> "And compare it to the alternative. If you hired a dedicated creative person to handle ad variations and client reporting for 50 accounts, you're looking at $4,000 a month minimum — and they'd take months to learn your system. We already built this for another Meta ads agency. The system exists. We're customizing it for you."

> "You told me this was 'a problem I've never been able to solve.' At less than the cost of one client's retainer, this is the solve."

### "Want to start small"

> "That's exactly what Option 1 is for. $7,500 one-time, we build the whole system, hand it off, and your team runs it. It's a lower monthly commitment. The tradeoff is you're investing your VA's time to manage it, and you don't get our ongoing optimization. But it's a real option if you want to test the waters before committing to managed."

### "Can I just do this myself with AI tools?"

> "You absolutely could. The question is time. You'd need to figure out how to ingest your vault, train the models, build the content pipeline, set up the reporting integrations, test everything, and iterate until the output quality matches your standard. That's 2 to 3 months of figuring it out — and that's time you should be spending on ad strategy, which is where you actually make money."

> "We already built this exact system. We plug you in now. You're live in four weeks instead of four months."

### "Need to discuss with my wife"

> "Absolutely — and honestly, she should love this. Think about what it does for her specifically. Right now she's handling client comms for 50 accounts with no automated reporting. This system sends every client a professional weekly report automatically. That alone probably saves her 10 to 12 hours a week. Instead of fielding 'how are my ads doing?' calls, clients are getting proactive updates. It makes her job significantly easier."

> "Happy to jump on a quick call with both of you if that would help."

### "Can you guarantee results?"

> "I can guarantee the system, the effort, and the ongoing optimization. What I can't guarantee is specific numbers — and anyone who does is lying to you. What I can tell you is we already built this for another Meta ads agency running Facebook ads for painters. It worked. It increased their output and helped them grow revenue 10 to 15 percent. Your vault of proven winners gives us an even stronger starting point than they had."

### "I need to think about it"

> "Totally fair. Here's what I'd keep in mind though — your peak season starts in March and April. The system takes four weeks to build. If we start now, you're live right when things ramp up. If we wait, you're heading into your busiest months with the same manual process and the same bottleneck."

> "What specifically do you want to think through? Is it the investment, the approach, or which option? I'd rather answer the real question now than have it linger."

---

## CLOSING (3-5 minutes)

> "So to recap — we're building you a three-part system. Your ad vault of hundreds of proven winners gets turned into an AI-powered creative engine that generates new ad variations at scale. Your personal content goes from fully manual to automated with a 15-minute daily review. And every one of your 50 clients gets automated weekly performance reports — something you said you don't have in place today."

> "The system is live in four weeks — just in time for peak season. And it directly solves the thing you told me has been 'a problem I've never been able to solve' for six and a half years."

**Plant the Yes/No frame:**

> "At the end of the day, there's really only two outcomes here — either this makes sense for where you're at or it doesn't. The one thing I want to avoid is 'let me think about it' — because that usually means there's a question I didn't answer. So if there's anything on your mind, let's get into it now."

**Ask for the close:**

> "Which option makes more sense for where you're at right now — the one-time build or the fully managed?"

**If he says fully managed:**

> "Great. I'll send the agreement over today. Once you sign, we start Week 1 this week — vault ingestion, AI training, integrations. Four weeks from now, you're live. That puts you right on time for the March ramp-up."

**If he says one-time build:**

> "Makes sense. I'll get the agreement to you today. Same four-week timeline — we build everything out, do a full handoff with training for you and your VA, and you've got two weeks of support after that."

**If he needs time:**

> "Totally understand. I'll send you the full proposal and the deck right after this call — take a look, run the numbers, talk to your wife. Here's what I'd keep in mind: four weeks to build means we need to start soon to be live for peak season. Would Thursday or Friday work for a quick follow-up?"

**Either way, close with:**

> "I'm genuinely excited about this, Matthew. You've spent six and a half years building one of the strongest ad systems in the roofing space — hundreds of proven winners, some of the leading ads in the industry, 50 clients on retainer. The only thing missing is the automation layer. That's what we're plugging in. The hard part — building the winning system — you already did. We just make it run without eating all your time."
