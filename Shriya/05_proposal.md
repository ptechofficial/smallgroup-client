# SERVICE PROPOSAL

**Agency Intelligence Engine — Campaign Monitoring, Competitor Analysis & Website Automation**

---

**Prepared by:** Small Group
**Prepared for:** Shriya Yerrabelly — Stratgo Media / Srinergy Global
**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Proposal valid until:** March 11, 2026

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

This proposal outlines the scope, deliverables, timeline, and investment for a custom-built Agency Intelligence Engine — designed specifically for Stratgo Media's multi-location digital marketing operations.

Small Group will build and deploy an AI-powered campaign monitoring system, automated competitor analysis pipeline, and website popup scheduling tool — so Stratgo Media can scale its client base without proportionally scaling headcount, eliminate wasted ad spend, and protect client revenue from operational oversights.

---

## 2. OBJECTIVES

- Automate daily monitoring of 30+ ad campaigns across all client locations (Meta & Google)
- Eliminate wasted ad budget caused by unmonitored campaigns and delayed optimization
- Provide AI-driven optimization suggestions pushed directly to Google Workspace
- Automate competitor ad tracking and deliver weekly competitive intelligence reports
- Deploy a scheduled popup system that eliminates the risk of forgotten website updates
- Enable Stratgo Media to scale operations without hiring additional monitoring staff

---

## 3. SCOPE OF WORK

### Month 1 — System Build & Launch

#### 3.1 Campaign Intelligence & Monitoring

- Connect to all client Meta and Google ad accounts via API
- Map all active campaigns (30+) across all locations
- Build AI analysis layer with metric-based rules (CTR thresholds, budget utilization, conversion benchmarks)
- Configure daily automated reports pushed to Google Workspace
- Set up real-time alerts for critical issues (budget bleeding, CTR drops, creative fatigue)

#### 3.2 Competitor Analysis & Creative Intelligence

- Build competitor ad tracking system using Meta Ad Library data
- Configure competitor lists per location (Sky Zone, Urban Air, local competitors)
- Create automated creative analysis pipeline (ad formats, messaging angles, promotional patterns)
- Set up weekly competitive intelligence reports delivered to Google Workspace
- Cross-reference competitor activity with client campaign performance

#### 3.3 Website Popup Automation

- Audit existing HyperKidz website infrastructure (PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML)
- Build form-based popup scheduling interface (Google Form or custom form)
- Develop automated popup deployment system compatible with existing tech stack
- Implement automatic popup removal based on scheduled end time
- Deploy and test across all 10 HyperKidz locations

---

### Month 2 Onward — Optimization & Support (If Managed Lead Gen Selected)

Starting from the second month, the focus shifts to:

1. **Lead Generation Pipeline**
   - Build cold email outreach sequences targeting Stratgo Media's ICP
   - Configure LinkedIn targeting for budding franchisees in FEC and Health & Wellness
   - Set up automated call booking pipeline connected to Stratgo Media's calendar
   - A/B test messaging, subject lines, and outreach cadence

2. **Ongoing Optimization**
   - Refine campaign monitoring rules based on first month's data
   - Expand competitor tracking as new clients or markets are added
   - Adjust alert thresholds based on team feedback

3. **Reporting**
   - Monthly lead gen performance report (outreach volume, response rates, calls booked)
   - Ongoing system health monitoring

---

## 4. PROJECTED RESULTS

Based on Stratgo Media's current campaign data and operational workflow:

| Metric | Monthly Projection |
|---|---|
| Campaigns monitored daily | 30+ (all active campaigns across Meta & Google) |
| Estimated ad waste prevented | $400-600/month (10% of managed spend) |
| Competitor reports delivered | 4 per month (weekly) |
| Popup incidents eliminated | All scheduled popups auto-managed, zero forgotten removals |

*Actual results depend on market conditions, ad account configurations, and team responsiveness to alerts — all of which Small Group will help optimize during the support period.*

## 5. TIMELINE

|---|---|---|
| **Connect & Map** | Week 1 | Connect Meta & Google ad accounts. Map all campaigns. Build data pipeline and configure analysis rules. |
