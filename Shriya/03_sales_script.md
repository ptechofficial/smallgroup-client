**Date:** February 25, 2026
**Call Type:** Pitch & close — present 3 systems, get a decision
**First Call:** February 8, 2026
**Goal:** She picks at least 1 system. Clear yes or no. No more back-and-forth.

---

## PRE-CALL INTEL

| What We Know | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Managing 30+ campaigns across 10 HyperKidz locations, small team | She needs automation — hiring for every 5 clients kills margins |
| Staff leave = unmonitored campaigns = $100+ wasted per incident | Money is being lost right now. Not hypothetical. |
| Forgotten popups cost clients full days of walk-in revenue | Small operational failure, massive client impact — and it's her reputation |
| $10k/mo revenue, growing, hiring through March | Growth phase but bottlenecked by operations |
| No lead gen system — all clients from word of mouth | Growth is unpredictable and unscalable |
| Budget: $2.5k one-time (ads), $300/mo (lead gen) | Cost-sensitive but ROI-driven |

## STEP 1: SET THE FRAME (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Be direct. Set expectations. Plant the close.

> "Shriya, thanks for getting on. I want to be upfront about how I want to spend the next 40 minutes.
>
> After our last conversation, I went deep on your three problems — the paid ad monitoring, the lead gen for Stratgo Media, and the website popup situation. I've put together three separate systems, each one designed around exactly what you told me.
>
> Here's how this will go: I'll do a quick recap to make sure nothing's changed on your end. Then I'll walk you through each system — what it is, exactly how it works, what it gives you, and what it costs. Three systems. Each one independent. You can pick one, two, or all three.
>
> At the end, there's really only two answers — yes, let's move on one of these, or no, it's not the right time. The one thing I want to avoid is 'let me think about it' — because we've been going back and forth for over a month now, and I think we both deserve a clear answer. Fair?"

**[Wait for agreement.]**

---

## STEP 2: QUICK DISCOVERY RECAP (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Confirm priorities, get her re-stating her pain, then bridge to the pitch.

### Confirm Priorities:

> "Before I share my screen, let me make sure I'm aligned with where you are right now. Last time you told me three things:
>
> One — you're running 30+ campaigns across all your clients on Meta and Google, and when someone on your team is out, campaigns bleed money. You said you want to 'make good use of every dollar and not bleed twenty of it.'
>
> Two — you have no lead gen system for Stratgo Media. All your clients have come through word of mouth. You want automated outreach to budding franchisees in FEC and health and wellness.
>
> Three — the website popup situation. If a private party popup stays up one extra day, the client loses an entire day of walk-in revenue.
>
> Has anything changed? Are these still the three priorities?"

**[Let her confirm or add context. Listen for any new info.]**

### Future State (get her excited):

> "So if we fast-forward 6 months and all three of these are solved — what does Stratgo Media look like? How many clients? What's the revenue?"

**[Let her paint the picture. Use her numbers later in the close.]**

### Current State Pain (bring her down to reality):

> "That's the goal. Now, right now — how is your team actually keeping up with monitoring 30 campaigns? How many hours a week is someone spending just checking ad accounts?"

> "And the popup thing — how many times in the last couple months has a popup stayed up longer than it should?"

> "You told me on our last call that you're 'still not out of the operations, very heavily invested in the operations.' Is that still true?"

### Bridge:

> "So here's the gap, Shriya: you want to scale to industry leaders in FEC and health and wellness. But right now, your time is going into monitoring campaigns, chasing popup removals, and you haven't had a chance to build any outreach system for your own business. You said it yourself — 'we never got a chance to work on our own thing.'
>
> Let me show you what I'd build. Three systems. Each one takes a specific problem off your plate."

**[Share screen. Open pitch deck.]**

---

## STEP 3: PRESENT 3 SYSTEMS (20 minutes)

**Open pitch deck. Walk through slides in order.**

> "I'm going to walk you through three independent systems. Each one solves a different problem. For each one, I'll show you what it is, exactly how it works end-to-end, what you get, and what it costs."

**[Slide 1: Title]** — Quick pause, let her see the overview.

**[Slide 2: Three Systems Overview]**

> "Here's the big picture. Three systems. Ad Intelligence, Lead Generation, and Website Automation. Each one is independent — you can pick one, two, or all three. Let me walk you through each one."

---

### SYSTEM 1: AD INTELLIGENCE & OPTIMIZATION

**[Slide 3: What & Why]**

> "System one. This is the one you were most vocal about on our last call.
>
> You're running 30+ campaigns across 10 locations. When someone's on leave for three days — your words — 'there's already a hundred dollars we've misused.' You want to make every dollar count. And you said you don't want to keep hiring people for every five new clients.
>
> On the left, that's the problem. On the right, that's what this system does. It monitors every campaign across every client, every day. It diagnoses what's wrong — bad creative, low budget, form issue — and tells your team exactly what to fix. It also tracks your competitors automatically, so no more manually checking Meta Ad Library for Sky Zone and Urban Air."

**[Slide 4: How It Works]**

> "Here's exactly how the pipeline works, end to end.
>
> First, I connect to all your Meta and Google ad accounts. Then every day, the system pulls the data — impressions, CTR, reach, conversions, spend. AI analyzes it against benchmarks. At the same time, it scans your competitors' ads from Meta Ad Library. Then it generates a daily report with specific action items and pushes it straight to your Google Workspace.
>
> Your team opens Google Workspace in the morning, and it's all there. Which campaigns are fine. Which ones need attention. And exactly what to do about it.
>
> Look at these diagnosis examples. CTR is high but conversions are low? The system tells you it's a landing page or form issue for that specific location. Reach is high but CTR is low? Creative is underperforming — and it'll cross-reference what competitors are running so you know what formats to try. Reach and impressions are low? Budget issue. These are the exact metric stories you described on our last call."

**[Slide 5: What You Get + Price]**

> "Here's what you get: daily campaign performance reports per client per location, AI-powered diagnosis with specific fix suggestions, automated competitor tracking, weekly competitor creative summaries, all pushed to Google Workspace. And it scales — every new client you onboard, you just add their accounts.
>
> The investment: $2,500, one-time. I build it, deploy it across all your current clients, train your team, and give you two weeks of post-launch support. Split payment — $1,250 upfront, $1,250 on delivery.
>
> Tool costs are separate and yours to own: N8N, AI API, hosting — roughly $70 to $150 a month.
>
> I want to be clear about something: this system delivers monitoring, alerts, and competitor data. Those are the outputs. I'm not guaranteeing revenue numbers or conversion rates — how your team acts on the alerts is what drives results. The system gives you the information. You make the decisions."

**[Pause. Let her absorb.]**

> "Questions about system one before I move to system two?"

---

### SYSTEM 2: LEAD GENERATION PIPELINE

**[Slide 6: What & Why]**

> "System two. This is about Stratgo Media's own growth.
>
> You've built to $10k a month entirely through word of mouth. That got you HyperKidz, that got you the health and wellness client. But word of mouth doesn't run on a schedule. You told me you 'never got a chance to work on your own thing' — no social media, no LinkedIn, no email outreach. This system puts your prospecting on autopilot.
>
> It finds prospects that match your ICP, runs cold email sequences, does LinkedIn outreach, classifies responses, and books qualified calls directly on your calendar. Your only job is to show up and close."

**[Slide 7: How It Works]**

> "Here's the pipeline. First, we define the targeting — your ICP: budding franchisees with one or two locations, FEC and health and wellness, USA, Australia, UK, Dubai, Canada. Minimum $3,000 service charge, minimum $3,500 ad spend.
>
> Then lead sourcing — we pull verified contacts from databases and LinkedIn. Then email outreach kicks in — multi-step sequences, value-first, hitting their pain points. At the same time, LinkedIn runs in parallel — connection requests, profile engagement, follow-ups. And at the end of the pipeline: interested prospects get a link to book a call directly on your calendar.
>
> On the right, you can see the email sequence structure. Email one leads with an industry insight and pain point. Email two drops value — a free resource or case context. Email three adds social proof and a direct call-to-action. Email four is a gentle follow-up or breakup. LinkedIn is running alongside the whole time."

**[Slide 8: What You Get + Price]**

> "Two options here.
>
> **Option A: I build it, you run it. $2,000 one-time.** You get the complete outreach infrastructure — email domains set up and warmed, ICP lead list sourced and verified, cold email sequences written and loaded, LinkedIn automation configured, response classification, calendar booking integration. Training plus two weeks of support. After that, you manage it — about 3 to 5 hours a week.
>
> **Option B: I build it and I run it. $500 a month.** Everything in Option A, plus I manage all outreach operations. Continuous lead sourcing, A/B testing, response handling, monthly reporting. Your only job is to show up to the calls that land on your calendar. Six-month commitment.
>
> Same thing as system one — the system delivers booked calls. Close rate depends on your sales conversations. I'm not guaranteeing how many clients you'll sign. I'm guaranteeing the system reaches the right people and gets them on your calendar.
>
> Tool costs: roughly $100 to $200 a month for email infrastructure, LinkedIn tools, and databases."

**[Pause.]**

> "Questions about lead gen?"

---

### SYSTEM 3: WEBSITE POPUP AUTOMATION

**[Slide 9: What & Why]**

> "System three. This is the one you said you wanted first.
>
> You told me on our last call — 'it looks like a small update, but it affects the cost for the customer in a huge way.' A private party popup stays up one extra day, people see the location is closed, they don't show up. That's a full day of walk-in revenue gone. Across 8 to 10 locations, this risk is happening every week.
>
> This system gives your team full control. They can manually add or remove a popup from any HyperKidz website instantly — no code, no developer. And if they know the schedule in advance, they set a start and end time and the system handles it automatically. Works with your existing PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML stack. No website rebuild."

**[Slide 10: How It Works + Price]**

> "The flow is simple. Your team gets a dashboard that covers all 8 to 10 HyperKidz websites. From there, they can do three things: manually add a popup to any site right now, manually remove a popup from any site right now, or schedule a popup with a start and end time and the system handles it automatically. No code, no developer, no FTP. Just pick the site, pick the message, and go.
>
> What you get: a single control panel for all HyperKidz locations, instant manual add and remove for any site, scheduled deployment and auto-removal when you want it hands-free, popup templates for common scenarios — private party, weather, closure — works on your existing PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML stack, and any team member can use it without being a developer.
>
> Pricing: $1,000, one-time. That covers all 8 to 10 websites. Live within 2 weeks — I build it, deploy it, and train your team. Split payment — $500 upfront, $500 on delivery. Minimal tool costs after that — maybe $10 to $20 a month for hosting."

**[Pause.]**

> "Questions about the popup system?"

---

### SUMMARY

**[Slide 11: All 3 Systems at a Glance]**

> "Here's all three side by side. Ad Intelligence: monitors your campaigns and competitors, $2,500 one-time. Lead Generation: finds prospects and books calls, $2,000 one-time or $500 a month managed. Website Automation: manage and schedule popups across all HyperKidz sites, $1,000.
>
> Each system is independent. You own everything I build. Even if we stop working together tomorrow, the systems stay yours."

**[Slide 12: Closing]**

> "So that's it. Three systems. Each one solves a specific problem you told me about. Pick the one that matters most right now, or pick all three."

---

## STEP 4: CLOSE (10 minutes)

### 4A: Open the Floor

> "What questions do you have?"

**Answer every question fully. Do not rush. Do not re-pitch.**

### 4B: Get Alignment

> "Based on what you just saw — do any of these systems solve the problems you're dealing with right now?"

**You need a clear yes. If she's vague:**
> "Which one stood out to you most?"

### 4C: Ask for the Decision

> "So which system do you want to start with?"

**If she's leaning toward one, confirm and move forward:**
> "Let's do it. I'll send you the agreement today. Once signed, I start this week."

**If she's interested in multiple:**
> "We can start all of them at once, or sequence them. What makes most sense for you right now?"

### 4D: Yes/No Frame (if she hesitates)

> "Shriya, I'm going to be straight with you. We've been talking since January. I've put real time into understanding your business and building out these systems. I want to work with you. But I need a clear answer today.
>
> Either one of these systems makes sense for where Stratgo Media is right now, or none of them do. Both answers are fine. But I can't do another round of 'let me think about it.' Can we keep it to a yes or a no?"

### 4E: If She Says Yes

**To Ad Intelligence:**
> "Done. I'll send the agreement today. $1,250 upfront, $1,250 on delivery. Here's what I need from you to start: Meta Business Manager access for all locations, Google Ads access if applicable, your competitor list per location, and Google Workspace admin access for the report delivery. Can you get me that by end of this week?"

**To Lead Gen (One-Time):**
> "Done. I'll send the agreement today. $1,000 upfront, $1,000 on delivery. I'll need your ICP doc finalized, your Calendly or Cal.com link, and any testimonials or case materials you have ready. When do you want to kick this off?"

**To Lead Gen (Managed):**
> "Smart move. I'll send the agreement today. Same setup — I'll need ICP, calendar link, and any materials. Six-month commitment starts when we go live. First month is $500. When are you ready to launch — March?"

**To Website Automation:**
> "Done. I'll send the agreement today. $500 upfront, $500 on delivery. I'll need website credentials and hosting access for all HyperKidz locations so I can build the control panel across all 8 to 10 sites. Can you get me that this week?"

**To Multiple Systems:**
> "Let's lock them all in. I'll send one agreement covering everything. I can start all of them immediately. Sound good?"

### 4F: If She Needs to Talk to Co-Founder

> "I understand. What specific questions would they have? Is it the investment, the approach, or which system? Let me answer those now so you can bring them the full picture instead of a summary."

### 4G: If She Says No

> "I respect that. Can I ask — is it the investment, the timing, or the approach? Just so I understand."

**Thank her. Offer to reconnect in 60 days. Move on.**

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive"

> "Which system are you looking at? Let me put the number in context.
>
> For ad intelligence — you're already losing money every time a campaign goes unmonitored. You told me $100 wasted in just one incident. Over six months, those incidents cost more than $2,500. The system pays for itself in prevented waste.
>
> For lead gen — one new client pays you $3,000 a month minimum. One close covers the entire build plus months of tool costs. The ROI math isn't close.
>
> For the popup — one forgotten popup that costs a client a full day of revenue is $1,000 to $3,000 lost. Prevent that once and the system is paid for."

### "I want to start with just the popup — can we do that first?"

> "Absolutely. That's why I built them as independent systems. $1,000 covers all 8 to 10 sites. $500 upfront, $500 on delivery. I just need website credentials and hosting access. Can you send that this week?"

### "GoMarble does something similar for the ad part"

> "GoMarble is built for D2C e-commerce brands running their own ads. It doesn't understand a multi-location franchise agency workflow — your client structure, your 30+ campaigns across different locations, your Google Workspace setup. What I'm building is designed around how Stratgo Media actually operates. It's not a generic SaaS tool. It's your system."

### "I need to talk to my co-founder first"

> "Completely understand. What specifically would they want to know? Let me address those questions right now so you can present the full picture. Is it the money, what's included, or the approach?"

### "Can we do $300/month for lead gen instead of $500?"

> "At $300, I'd have to cut the outreach volume — fewer emails, fewer LinkedIn touches, slower pipeline. At $500, I can actually hit the channels properly. And remember — your ICP pays you $3,000 a month minimum. One closed client gives you a 6x return on a full year of lead gen. The $200 difference is what makes the system actually effective."

### "Let me think about it"

> "What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the money, the approach, or which system to start with? Let's talk through whatever it is right now. You have me here, and I can answer anything. I don't want you to leave this call with unanswered questions."

### "I can't commit to all three right now"

> "You don't have to. That's why they're independent. Pick the one that solves your biggest pain point today. We start there. The others are available whenever you're ready."

### "Can I DIY this / get it cheaper on Upwork?"

> "You could get someone to build pieces of it. But you'd spend weeks specifying what you need, managing the developer, testing whether it actually works with your ad accounts and your website stack. I've already spent time understanding your workflow. I know your campaigns, your competitors, your client structure. You're not paying for code — you're paying for a system built around how your agency actually operates."

---

## POST-CALL ACTIONS

**If she picks one or more systems:**
1. Send agreement within 2 hours (specific to the system(s) chosen)
2. Send WhatsApp checklist of what you need from her
3. For Ad Intelligence: request Meta Business Manager, Google Ads, competitor lists, Google Workspace access
4. For Lead Gen: request finalized ICP doc, calendar link, any testimonial materials
5. For Website: request website credentials for code review, then follow up with final quote
6. Start infrastructure setup same day

**If she asks for time:**
1. Send WhatsApp within 1 hour: summary of the 3 systems + prices

3. Do NOT send the full proposal — that's your leverage

**If she says no:**
1. Thank her
2. Offer to reconnect in 60 days
3. Move on — do not chase

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Three independent systems, not a bundle.** Let her choose. Don't pressure all three.
2. **Use her exact words throughout.** "Bleed money," "hiring folks for every five clients," "heavily invested in operations," "never got a chance to work on our own thing."
3. **No revenue or conversion guarantees.** Be explicit: the systems deliver outputs (reports, booked calls, auto-removed popups). Results depend on her team's actions.
4. **Her HyperKidz growth story is your anchor.** She took 3 locations to 10+. Reference it: "You proved you can deliver. Now you need systems that scale with you."
5. **Custom-built is your differentiator.** Not GoMarble. Not a SaaS tool. Not a generic Upwork build. This is built around her specific workflow.
6. **Be direct on the close.** She has rescheduled multiple times and delayed info sharing. This call is the decision point. Respectful but firm.
7. **Start with whatever she's ready for.** If she only wants the popup, take the popup. Get in the door. The other systems come later.
8. **Pricing is firm.** Don't negotiate on the call. If she pushes, offer to split payments — not lower the price.
