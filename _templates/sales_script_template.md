## STEP 1: SET THE FRAME (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Establish authority. Lay out expectations. Plant the close early.

> "{{CLIENT_NAME}}, thanks for jumping back on. Before we dive in, let me lay out how I want to spend the next 45 minutes.
>
> I went deep on your business after our last call. {{AUTHORITY_STATEMENT — what research you did}}. And I'll be honest — {{PROOF_STATEMENT — reference to existing system/client if applicable}}.
>
> Here's how this will go: I'm going to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand where you're headed. Then I'll walk you through exactly what we'd build, phase by phase, with timelines. I'll show you the numbers — real numbers, not hype. And I'll break down what it costs.
>
> At the end, there's really only two outcomes — either this makes sense for where you are and we get moving, or it doesn't and I'll tell you that honestly. I'm not going to waste your time or mine. Sound fair?"

---

## STEP 2: DISCOVERY — ROLLER COASTER METHOD (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Get them to sell themselves on why they need this. Future state first, then current state pain.

### PART A: FUTURE STATE (Start here — get them excited)

> "Before I show you anything, I want to understand where you're trying to go. Forget the automation for a second.
>
> If we fast-forward 6 months and everything went right — what does your business look like? {{SPECIFIC_FUTURE_STATE_QUESTION}}"

**Dig deeper:**
> "And when you say {{THEIR_GOAL}} — what does that look like in revenue? Ballpark?"
> "Are you planning to stay solo or build a team around this?"
> "{{ADDITIONAL_FUTURE_QUESTION}}"

**What you're listening for:**
- Their revenue target — use this in the pitch
- Whether they're thinking small or big
- Expansion plans — this seeds Phase 2

### PART B: CURRENT STATE PAIN (Now bring them down to reality)

> "Got it. So that's the goal. Let me ask you this — right now, {{CURRENT_STATE_QUESTION}}?"

**Then dig in:**
> "And out of those, how many turn into actual {{DESIRED_OUTCOME}}?"
> "You mentioned {{THEIR_STORY_FROM_CALL_1}} — how often does that happen?"
> "How long can you keep doing this manually?"

**The bridge statement:**

> "So here's the gap: you want {{THEIR_STATED_GOAL}}, but right now you're {{THEIR_CURRENT_REALITY}}. The math doesn't work at this pace. What if I showed you how to {{YOUR_SOLUTION_TEASER}}?"

---

## STEP 3: THREE-PILLAR PITCH (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Present the solution in three clear pillars using the PFS framework (Problem -> Feature -> Solution).

> "Here's what we'd build for you. I'm going to break it into three parts because there are really three problems to solve."

### PILLAR 1: "{{PILLAR_1_HEADLINE}}"

**Problem** (use their words):
> "You told me that {{THEIR_PAIN_1}}. That works, but {{WHY_ITS_LIMITED}}."

**Feature:**
> "What we build is {{FEATURE_1_DESCRIPTION}}.
>
> {{FEATURE_1_DETAILS — specifics, numbers, how it works}}"

**Solution** (their desired outcome):
> "{{HOW_THIS_GETS_THEM_WHAT_THEY_WANT}}"

---

### PILLAR 2: "{{PILLAR_2_HEADLINE}}"

**Problem** (use their words):
> "Right now you're {{THEIR_PAIN_2}}. {{WHY_ITS_A_CEILING}}."

**Feature:**
> "{{FEATURE_2_DESCRIPTION}}.
>
> {{FEATURE_2_DETAILS — specifics, numbers, how it works}}"

**PROOF DROP** (show it's real):
> "And {{CLIENT_NAME}} — this isn't a proposal I'm reading off a page. We already built this exact system for a client. {{PROOF_DETAILS — what the system does, results if available}}.
>
> The engine already exists. For your business, we customize {{CUSTOMIZATION_DETAILS}}. But the system? It's built. It's running."

**Solution** (their desired outcome):
> "{{HOW_THIS_GETS_THEM_WHAT_THEY_WANT_2}}"

---

### PILLAR 3: "{{PILLAR_3_HEADLINE}}"

**Problem** (use their exact story):
> "You told me {{THEIR_STORY}} — {{WHY_THIS_MATTERS_AT_SCALE}}."

**Feature:**
> "{{FEATURE_3_DESCRIPTION}}.
>
> {{FEATURE_3_DETAILS}}"

**Solution** (their desired outcome):
> "{{HOW_THIS_GETS_THEM_WHAT_THEY_WANT_3}}"

---

## STEP 4: PHASE 2 TEASE (3 minutes)

**Goal:** Don't sell Phase 2 now. Plant the seed so they see the long-term vision.

> "{{CLIENT_NAME}}, that's Phase 1. And I want to be straight with you — Phase 1 alone will {{PHASE_1_VALUE}}. But here's what gets me excited about Phase 2, once this is running.
>
> {{PHASE_2_VISION — expansion opportunities, additional channels, new markets}}
>
> But that's down the road. Phase 1 first. Prove the machine, then scale it."

---

## STEP 5: PRICING & TIMELINE (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Value stack first. Then drop the price. Then silence.

### Timeline First (Build Urgency):

> "Let me walk you through the timeline because I know you want to start seeing results fast.
>
> **Week 1:** {{WEEK_1}}
> **Week 2:** {{WEEK_2}}
> **Week 3:** {{WEEK_3}}
> **Week 4:** {{WEEK_4}}
>
> By the end of month 1, {{MONTH_1_RESULT}}. By month 2, {{MONTH_2_RESULT}}."

### Value Stack (Before Price):

> "So for everything included — here's what you're getting:
>
> - {{VALUE_ITEM_1}}
> - {{VALUE_ITEM_2}}
> - {{VALUE_ITEM_3}}
> - {{VALUE_ITEM_4}}
> - {{VALUE_ITEM_5}}
> - Weekly reporting so you know exactly what's working"

### Tool Costs (Separate First — Anchor Low):

> "First, the tools. These are third-party subscriptions you'd own directly:
>
> {{TOOL_COST_BREAKDOWN}}
>
> Total tool cost: roughly ${{TOOLS_TOTAL}} per month. You own all of it."

### Two Options:

**Option 1 (the anchor):**

> "**Option 1: We build the entire system and hand it to you. One-time fee: ${{ONE_TIME_FEE}}.**
>
> {{OPTION_1_DETAILS — what's included, what client manages, tradeoffs}}"

**Option 2 (the recommended):**

> "**Option 2: We build it AND we run it for you. ${{MONTHLY_FEE}} per month, 6-month commitment.**
>
> {{OPTION_2_DETAILS — what's included, what client does, why it's better}}
>
> Your only job is {{CLIENT_ONLY_JOB}}. That's it."

**[SILENCE. Let them process. Do not fill the gap.]**

### The ROI Math:

> "{{CLIENT_NAME}}, {{ROI_COMPARISON — their revenue per deal vs. your cost, paid alternatives vs. your cost}}. The ROI math isn't even close."

---

## STEP 6: CLOSE (5 minutes)

### 6A: Exhaust All Questions

> "What questions do you have about either option?"

**Answer every single question. Do not rush. Do not re-pitch.**

### 6B: Get Alignment

> "Based on everything we just walked through, do you feel like this system would get you to {{THEIR_STATED_GOAL}}?"

**You need a clear YES. If wishy-washy, dig in:**
> "What part are you unsure about? Let me address that."

### 6C: Yes or No Frame

> "{{CLIENT_NAME}}, I know there's usually three things someone can say at this point — yes let's do it, no it's not for me, or 'let me think about it.' And I want you to know I'm completely fine with a no. The one I want to avoid is the 'let me think about it' — because in my experience that usually just means there's a question I didn't answer. So can we keep it to a yes or a no?"

### 6D: Assume the Close

**If they pick Option 2 (managed):**
> "Smart move. Next steps are simple — I'll send you the agreement today. Once that's signed, we start {{FIRST_ACTION}} tomorrow. Sound good?"

**If they pick Option 1 (one-time build):**
> "Done. I'll send the agreement today. Once signed, we start building immediately. And if down the road you want us to take over management — that option's always there."

**If they need time:**
> "No problem. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the investment, the approach, or which option to go with? Let's talk through it now so you have everything you need to make a decision."

**If they say no:**
> "Totally respect that. Can I ask what the main concern is? Just so I know for my own learning."

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive / I need to keep costs low"

> "I hear you. {{COST_REFRAME — compare to their current time investment, compare to alternatives like paid ads or hiring, frame against revenue per deal}}. The question isn't whether you can afford it — it's whether you can afford to keep doing {{THEIR_MANUAL_PROCESS}} for the next 6 months."

### "I want to start small / just test it"

> "That's exactly what this is. Phase 1 is the test. And if you want the smallest commitment possible, Option 1 is a one-time ${{ONE_TIME_FEE}} build. You own everything. If the numbers work, we scale to Phase 2 together. If they don't, you still have the entire infrastructure."

### "I talked to someone cheaper / can I use a freelancer?"

> "For sure — there are people who'll {{CHEAP_ALTERNATIVE}}. But here's the difference: we already have this system built and running for a client right now. {{DIFFERENTIATION — what you do that a freelancer doesn't}}. You can buy the plumbing cheap. What you're paying for with us is a proven engine that's already generating results."

### "Can I just buy the tools and do it myself?"

> "Absolutely. But here's the reality — we've already built this system, debugged it, and have it running live. You'd be spending the next 2-3 months figuring out the tools on your own. Meanwhile, you're still {{THEIR_CURRENT_PAIN}}. Or — we plug you into a system that's already proven, and you're {{DESIRED_SPEED_RESULT}}. Which gets you there faster?"

### "Can you guarantee results?"

> "I can't guarantee specific numbers — no one honestly can. What I can guarantee is the system, the effort, and the continuous optimization. {{PROOF_REFERENCE — case study, existing client results}}. And because we're managing it month over month, we're constantly adjusting based on what the data tells us."

### "I need to think about it"

> "Totally fair. I'll send you the full proposal and the deck right after this call. Here's what I'd keep in mind though — {{URGENCY_STATEMENT — market timing, competitive window, cost of delay}}. When would be a good time to reconnect — would {{DAY_1}} or {{DAY_2}} work?"

## POST-CALL ACTIONS

**If they close:**
1. Send agreement within 2 hours
2. Send "Welcome" email with Week 1 checklist (what they need to provide)

1. Send follow-up email within 1 hour summarizing the three pillars and the numbers
2. Include a one-page comparison: "Manual vs. System"
3. Set a specific follow-up time

**If they say no:**
1. Thank them
2. Offer to reconnect in 30 days
3. Move on

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Do NOT lead with tools or features.** Lead with THEIR goals, THEIR numbers, THEIR words from the first call.
2. **Use their exact language.** Mirror their words back to them.
3. **Their best story is your anchor.** Use their own success story 2-3 times during the pitch.
4. **Don't over-explain the tech.** They care about outcomes, not tool names.
5. **"We already built this" is your killer line.** Mention it three times: frame, proof drop, objection handling.
6. **Cost sensitivity is real but solvable.** Frame every cost against their revenue per deal.
7. **Phase 2 is the retention play.** Plant the seed so they see you as a long-term partner.
