  So we Fathom, and we were just talking about were just about Fathom. So we Hey, Joseph! Hey, what's up?  Can you hear me?

1:10 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yeah, I can hear you. Just give me a second.

1:12 - Tushar Mangla
  Nice.

1:13 - Joseph Cyriac
  Everybody's on. Hold on one second. Let me log back in. One second.

1:41 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank Thank

3:00 - Tushar Mangla
  Oh, okay. Nice.

3:05 - Joseph Cyriac
  What time is it there? It's 10.30. Okay. Not too bad. Thanks for hopping on. Anyways, what you got? Go ahead.  Yeah.

3:15 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So I see you booked the call from Calendly. May I know what prompted you to book the call?

3:20 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yeah. So listen, I'm starting. It's just me. I'm going to start like a firm, right? If you look at my LinkedIn, like I started, I worked in a startup.  And so it was AI staffing. And so the dev team that we had was out of Poland. And so like, dude, they came up with using N8N, using virtual machines.  They were able to use browser flow or no ads power for LinkedIn. And then we had LinkedIn recruiter pro.  And then we would. would. would. I'll sign up for, I guess, Sales Navigator, and I want to search, let's say, certain whatever, like Director of Construction, right?  So my goal is I'm going to, right now, I haven't spun up anything. It's just me. I want to basically add this many people, right, the limit that LinkedIn allows, search for, like, let's say, Director, Project Manager for data centers, right?  The staffing that I'm going to do is that I'm going to try to place, like, try to get a contract with him for electricians, if that makes sense, right?  Mm-hmm. So basically, I would go and I would add on LinkedIn, the search would be, like, Manager, data center, you know, or Project Manager, data center.  Instruction, whatever. In the search, add these people, right? And then I want to automate adding them. And then the other part being is sending messages, if that makes sense.  You know, a note, right? Basically, every day, it doesn't have to be massive. And I want to see if that works, then I'm open to getting like Recruiter.  In the previous company, we had Recruiter Pro. And, you know, we spent a good amount on in-mails and things like that, but it was helpful or it was successful to proving it out.  But yeah, that's the goal. Basically, to search for a project manager of a data center construction, right? In the U.S., add them, right?  And then turn around maybe the next day, look at who's been, you know, who I been recently added, right, and then send them a message, preset message, right, to do that.  And there's companies that do this, like I saw, right, like, and so my goal was to, like, see if we can, you know, do this and prove it out and then go from there.  And then I would, you know, because I tested this, so let's say I sent a message, right, LinkedIn message to this guy.  He is a project manager for this company that's helping on an energy or solo project or whatever it was, and then he responded, hey, man, I do need the help.  I don't know who that would be. We work with staffing companies, right, reach out to this person, right? And I said, thank you so much, and then I reached out to that person via phone.  I was able to get a contract, right, for staffing, to staff electricians with that. So I know it works.  And this is basically what I want to do the same for email, which would be basically if I was to identify through LinkedIn, these, these, let's say these project managers for whatever construction, I would want to send them an email also.  Right. And we can, you know, I mean, there's several ways to craft that or, you know, not craft the email, but grab the email, if that makes sense.  Um, and then send them a message like, Hey, I'm Joseph. I work with, you know, whatever staffing, uh, we, we have ready, you know, electricians, like I have the message, right?  Yeah. I've got lots of calls coming now. Um, anyways, and same thing, right? Yeah. And that's it. And then, you know, I want to automate this basically.  Um, and that's it.

8:57 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  You know, we'll be seeing a target, uh, The niche that you're trying to talk about, that's going to be construction companies.  Correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9:06 - Joseph Cyriac
  Basically, that hires a... Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah.

9:39 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Yeah. So we are targeting construction companies. And when we say that we want to pitch out the project managers through LinkedIn, is it going to be a one-time job or are we doing it regularly?  No, it'll be repeated, right? So, you know, ideally what happens is, you know, there are, of course, there are going to be some changes.  across the jobs, but let's say there are 10,000 project managers across the world, right? And we can either have, we can either run it one time to get all the 10,000 project managers once, and then we can do the follow-ups over a period of time.  And we can keep updating the database probably monthly. That can be one case. The second case is we, of course, we create a new CRM.  We run it every week. We try to target 100 to 1,000 project managers in a week. And we put the unique, unique one into our CRM, and then we start following up, right?  Those are the two methods that I can think of right now. Yeah.

10:38 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yeah. Right, right, right. Yeah. We use HubSpot. had sequences in the previous company. Yeah.

10:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So what are we exactly? Go ahead. Go ahead.

10:50 - Joseph Cyriac
  My, question is again, so you mentioned that this is what you're looking for.

10:54 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So what exactly are the key metrics that we're trying to target from this? How many…

11:00 - Joseph Cyriac
  We want to get staffing, right? Contracts from companies, right? That's all we want. That's all I want, right? Electricians, that's all I want, right?  In construction. Oh, God, everybody. Oh, go ahead.

11:19 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Hi, Joseph.

11:21 - Tushar Mangla
  Hey, what's up, man? So, yeah, if I summarize, you know, our conversation that you want a system where you will get like some specific target positions of some specific companies or industry, that's a construction company, and you want some of the employees, like project managers, or maybe some other position, right?  Okay, so if I ask you that, you know, like, what's your success metrics look like here?

11:55 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yeah, I mean, metrics would be, listen, I We would look at response rates, right? Maybe warm up some domains so that if they don't respond, I don't want to get blocked as spam, right?  We're doing mass emails. Success would be like, I don't know, 30% to 40% if I got something like that.  And then out of that 30 to 40% response rate, I was able to get, I don't know, 15% to agree to a, you know, a meeting with me.

12:42 - Tushar Mangla
  What's the current number? What do you mean current number? I'm sure that you guys are doing it manually if you're doing it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been doing it like every night.

12:55 - Joseph Cyriac
  So it's about that. I would say it's like, you know, since it's more. Right. I just want them to be involved in the project or, you know what I mean?  Construction level, right? Or in the operations or project management, you know, because you get into sales, right? It doesn't work because let's say somebody's doing sales.  He's like, oh, yeah, you know, you need to talk to someone. So, right. And then operations guy might tell me, it's like, hey, you need to talk to our HR side, right?  Our human resource, right? They do the hiring. And so they do the contracts, right? So things like that.

14:34 - Tushar Mangla
  So what position will not work for your business? Like, I'm still not getting that understanding of your business, right?  Like, what's your business about? And what's your pitch to them? And what do you think?

14:45 - Joseph Cyriac
  Hey, yeah, the pitch would be like, hey, I, um, hold on. I had so much. Here, I'm going to pull up, uh, it's  That I use, okay, so one of the guys is like, whatever, hey, John, I want to reach out, introduce myself and my team, we support data center constructions and operations with full electrical labor solutions, right, providing everything from journeyman electricians to performance to QA and QC support, commissioning controls, right, we work on a contract basis, and a contract to firm, right, that means you start as a contractor, and you can get higher contract to higher basis, and we help teams quickly scale quickly for both short and long term site needs.  Would you be available anytime this week, or next week, right? Best, Joe. This was an in-mail, but I could do the same for email, and this guy was in operations, cloud operations, so yeah, go ahead.

16:19 - Tushar Mangla
  So basically you want the details of those employees who can make the decision for your email or maybe the contract one.  Yeah, and so today I had one, right?

16:31 - Joseph Cyriac
  He didn't respond. I send that email or in-mail, right? He didn't respond, right? I add him on LinkedIn, right?  Or I send him a message, right? I'll do both. Usually I'll add and send a message, or I'll send a message and add.  It doesn't matter. But the point being is that one guy didn't respond. Then I said, hey, man, or hey, just follow it up, you know, would love to, you know.  come Well, And He then responded back to me and said, hey, I appreciate you following up, right? Because he didn't respond to the first email.  Then he said, hey, I'm the wrong person. I'm a field manager. You actually need to talk to this person, right?  So then, right, it's in there. I took that person, right? Then I went and looked it up, you know, using one of the, you know, the lookup softwares, whatever, right?  I've used all of them. What is it? Rocky Ridge, Seamless, you know, you got Apollo, you got Lush, whatever, right?  I go and look it up. And then I find that guy, right? And in that case, I called that guy.  And then, it worked, right? The guy was like, yeah, dude. Okay, cool. Can you talk to Zach, the field manager?  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we do need help. With electricians all over the country, whatever, right? And then he said, let's see if we can do, yeah, work together.  Okay.

18:11 - Tushar Mangla
  So Joseph, as I see that you are saying 20 to 30% reply rate is not that bad, right? If you are expecting 30 to 40, so what exactly is your pain point here?  Yeah, the point is I wanna automate this, right?

18:27 - Joseph Cyriac
  One, right? I wanna go in, search, automate, right? Then what I wanna do is automate the search part, automate the messaging part, right?  And then I wanna, you know, have followups and everything else and then, you know, drum up new business, right?  That's it, new accounts, right?

18:53 - Tushar Mangla
  New net logos, right?

18:54 - Joseph Cyriac
  We say, right, get new business. That's it. Okay.

19:00 - Tushar Mangla
  So basically, let's say if you can get a system, right, so how, if you could please explain to me currently, how are you searching your current target audience?  Like, what parameters are you giving? Let's say, if you are on the LinkedIn, right? So what, what keywords are you searching?  What's your target audience? How are you defining that these are your exact ICP? Yeah.

19:22 - Joseph Cyriac
  So, so basically, I'm looking at, it's, I just search right on LinkedIn. And I search for, like I said, director of operations or project management, construction, right?  you know, data center, project manager for data center construction. Like that's a search team I can, I can do in Google.  I mean, not Google, but LinkedIn, right?

19:57 - Tushar Mangla
  Could you share me like how exactly. You are targeting and filtering your current customers. Sure, sure, sure.

20:09 - Joseph Cyriac
  So you can see my screen.

20:13 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Okay, cool.

20:14 - Joseph Cyriac
  So like, okay, so I'm gonna go, let's just do it. All right, okay, so I'm gonna take these guys only in the US, right?  Look at that, and I'm gonna, oh, looks like I'm already connected. No, I'm not connected. So I would want to connect, right?  Send a message, right? And so I'm gonna go here, right? I haven't sent a message. So yeah, this is a premium one, but not like a sales navigator.  But yeah, so basically I would go and send her a message, right? That message that I set about, what is that?  Um, so do you have the sales navigator as well?

21:33 - Tushar Mangla
  Like if you could please share, if you have, you, I guess, you know, we can get this type of data from that as well.  And we can easily extract the data and automate your whole process. If you're talking about the bulk. Correct.

21:48 - Joseph Cyriac
  I mean, yeah, I can get sales now. That's not a problem. I just, I don't.

21:53 - Tushar Mangla
  Got it. So Joseph, if I ask you, let's say, if you got the data of, you know, Tanmay, let's say today, how are you defining your unit?

22:06 - Joseph Cyriac
  This is your fresh lead. I'm sorry, let's repeat that again.

22:10 - Tushar Mangla
  Sorry, how are you defining that? Let's say Tanmay is your fresh lead?

22:16 - Joseph Cyriac
  How am I defining what's a fresh lead? Tanmay.

22:20 - Tushar Mangla
  So you can see that Tanmay is the first name in the list in the top of the list. He's referring to that.

22:28 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Yeah, so he's saying that, how are you defining that Tanmay? He's your fresh lead. How am I defining he is my lead?

22:38 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yes.

22:40 - Tushar Mangla
  Fresh lead, I think.

22:41 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So basically, what happens is this, let me just fill in the context. So you, of course, you have maybe contacted 1000 previous project managers.  If you're contacting the next one, 1001 project manager, how are you defining that 1001 project manager is the new one?  So there should be some other parameters as well. For example, I think maybe a fresh lead criteria can be that he is not connected to him.  I think that can be one scenario. Yeah.

23:10 - Joseph Cyriac
  So, yeah. Yeah. I mean, to your point, right, we can look at, I mean, we could, well, on recruiter side, sorry.  Yeah. Recruiter, used to be able to, to your point, to pick if I've ever messaged him. Is that available in Sales Navigator, if I've messaged them?  The filter that you have messaged him or not? Yeah, yeah. It used to be, it used to be. To, no, that's not it.  I wonder if Sales Navigator used to that. Okay. Anyways, I, if there is a filter, we would use it.  I'm going to, okay, let's just see. totally. But, Yeah, it does. Sales Navigator does. People you interacted with, okay.

24:28 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Yeah, recently messaged, exclude leads.

24:31 - Joseph Cyriac
  So I would use that.

24:34 - Tushar Mangla
  So Joseph, if I ask a question that you are saying, that if I message them today, what if you get, you know, like, hundreds or thousands of data today?  So when will you again want to contact those persons? Because I'm sure that in one, yeah, yeah, kind of.  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, So. So. So. So.

24:59 - Joseph Cyriac
  So. So. So. So. So. I would say it's like, you know, I would want to follow up, like, within a week.  So if I sent, let's say, her a message, right? I would want to send her a message, right? A week later, right?  Okay.

25:23 - Tushar Mangla
  And how much data are you expecting in one day? Well, so here's the thing, right?

25:30 - Joseph Cyriac
  So I'm, I'm gonna, so this was my old company that I left. But anyway, so basically, what I would want to do is, is, I mean, I just want to test this out initially, and then I'm willing to scale if it works, right?

25:48 - Tushar Mangla
  That's it.

25:50 - Joseph Cyriac
  So like, if it's, if it's, if, if we'll test this out with Sales Navigator, I'm happy to buy it.  And then if it's, if the response rate is good. Right. it Initially, shoot, don't need, I don't even find, we don't even have to do 40%.  We can give it a 20% response rate, right? And then from there, so if they respond, right, that's 20% response rate.  Then if I can get to 12% of booking a meeting, I would consider that a win, right? So they respond, I want 20% response rate, right?  Hey, not interested, blah, blah, right? Or, hey, right, not a good time, whatever. Or you need to, you have the wrong person, reach out to this person, right?  That's what I would want to do, right? So that's 20%. Then I would want 10% to 12% of, hey, yeah, hey, we're interested.  Or, hey, you need to, yeah, you know, let's meet. I can meet two weeks from now, right? So that's a success.  That's a win, right? So that would count towards the 10%, 10 to 12%, if that makes sense.

27:05 - Tushar Mangla
  So you're saying that 10 to 12% is a win for you. So is this from LinkedIn DMs or from the email replied?  So here's the thing, right?

27:16 - Joseph Cyriac
  I would want LinkedIn and we test this with LinkedIn email. And then we would do this also, we can do this with email.  Sure. You know, I guess there is a limit of LinkedIn that you can automatically, right?

27:31 - Tushar Mangla
  I was 25 per week, right? 100, 100 per week, I think. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So that's for sales navigator.

27:39 - Joseph Cyriac
  No, so using LinkedIn for new people.

27:41 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  think you can reach out a hundred people. think that's a soft limit that they automatically sending in the connection request.

27:46 - Tushar Mangla
  Yes. Okay. Oh, that's it a week. Okay. Yeah. So that's why let's say if, you know, will start from the email part because that's the very easy solution.  And. You know, so if you start from the LinkedIn, so what number are you expecting from one day that if we target top decision maker of any company, right?  So how many emails are you expecting that you will get one day? 100,000 or 5,000? What do we have a number?  So let's just go with what LinkedIn allows, right?

28:23 - Joseph Cyriac
  So you said I get 100 connects a week. Is that right? Yeah. And then how many emails do I get?

28:30 - Tushar Mangla
  You know, now you get like, I guess email exception is not dependent on the LinkedIn, but he's talking about the LinkedIn in me.

28:39 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So for that, I think there's a credit plan. I think it's going to be 50 or 60 in mail that you can send.

28:50 - Joseph Cyriac
  Credits. Okay. Yeah, I know about that. You can get more credits, I think.

29:08 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  This is exactly 50 on a monthly basis. So maybe you can use multiple.

29:14 - Joseph Cyriac
  So if there is sales navigator, it is going to be 150. Message. Is that 150 a month? Yeah. Monthly basis.  Wow. Okay. That's it. LinkedIn is horrible. we would need to. Oh, man. Yeah, that's what CurtaPro included. Actually a lot more.  Anyways, cool. So what we would do here is that we would test Yeah, let's test with LinkedIn, right? Basically.  Yeah, I would want to test with LinkedIn and then that's there. Here's another And we could, it's going to be, of course, it's to be cheaper to do an email, right?

30:06 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Yeah. Yeah. Cause so we would search with LinkedIn, get their email.

30:12 - Joseph Cyriac
  How many connects max can I do on, on, uh, you know, we can do a hundred connects. That's it.  Yes. Yes. Cause what I was thinking was like, we would search for them, connect with them. So that, yeah.  So that won't even matter. Cause I was thinking it's like, yeah. Okay, cool. we can do this.

30:36 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  We can use multiple accounts, multiple parallel accounts. I know, I know I did that.

30:41 - Joseph Cyriac
  Uh, we rented accounts really. Yeah. Um, okay. Keep going. Um, yeah, I think that the best easiest scalable way to do this is, uh, uh, uh, uh, wanna.  All I out kind of initially on whatever, my LinkedIn, whatever it is, to send, yeah, to your point, I want to test out on the email side, right, sending them a message, right, and then sending, grabbing their email, and then sending an email also.  Yeah, I think it will have to be both ways.

31:26 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Because in the email, we can send as much as we want, right?

31:29 - Joseph Cyriac
  I mean, can do 10,000, whatever, right?

31:32 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Yeah, so what I see, what I actually suggest in this scenario is, let's say we are able to fetch 1,000 project managers in a week, right, and that way, I would like to connect 100, top 100 project managers that matches to my understanding, you know, that those are easier to connect with, and high conversion rate candidates, I will simply connect with them on LinkedIn, and the rest 900, I will actually try to reach out to on email.  Okay. So, so it's going to be both. Thank

32:03 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yeah.

32:03 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  the, uh, hundred connects that we do, and then we're going to send the DMS as well as the in mails and everything, because there's two ways.  See, there is a LinkedIn in mail. That is, if you are not even connected to them, you can send them any, uh, DM.  There is also when you connect with the link, uh, with someone on LinkedIn, then you can send a free DMS, right?  And you don't have to use email. So it is going to be upwards or north of 150, uh, DMs easily because we have the in mail credits.  Sure. Those are two things that I am actually considering. So, uh, and you know, our, our target is going to be two fronts.  The thing is, if you're trying to get, let's say, 10 or 20 or 50 good candy, you know, converted leads into your funnel, then I believe either we can try to target a hundred leads and try to convert those hundred out to 50.  Or what we can do is we can target 1000 leads. We can try it on multiple.

34:00 - Joseph Cyriac
  Right? LinkedIn is what people use for, I mean, you know, people get all kinds of emails, right? LinkedIn is a little bit, you know, there's less emails, right?  Oh, okay.

34:14 - Tushar Mangla
  I think from LinkedIn, should be higher conversion rate, right?

34:17 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Exactly.

34:17 - Joseph Cyriac
  That's the hope. That's kind of what I've seen, right? Hey, you're not interested. Okay, cool. Right?

34:25 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So I'll be, Joseph, I think you mentioned that you were working with a company and now you are trying it out on your own.  Okay.

34:32 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yeah. So I'm not with VeroSkills, right? I'm not with VeroSkills. I'm branching out on my own. So that's what I'm needing to do.  That's why like, that's why like, I'm reaching out to you guys, you know, I was on Upwork, right? Some guy from Pakistan was like, dude, we could do all this, you know, blah, blah.

34:53 - Tushar Mangla
  Same thing.

34:54 - Joseph Cyriac
  So, so I'm just kind of looking at cost is important to me as I prove this out.

35:00 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  And how did you get my Calendly? I'm just, I'm also curious in that. Yeah, of course. I saw Tushar, you too.

35:07 - Joseph Cyriac
  You guys were both in like, I think you guys post on Reddit, right? Yeah.

35:13 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  And then I saw on, what is that?

35:15 - Joseph Cyriac
  The N8N Facebook group, was it? Must be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you just graduated, right? College or something, right?  You started this small, what is the company? I forget what you hit. Yeah, yeah. Very good. Great. Great job.  So Joseph, you mentioned the Reddit part, like, what's that about? Sorry, go ahead.

35:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  I think you mentioned Reddit as well as Facebook. So, yeah.

35:54 - Tushar Mangla
  Like, where basically did you get, you know, is a Prakash Calendary link? So I'm just curious. I'm sorry, what's that like from where did you get the precursor any link that you mentioned Reddit, then YouTube?  I think it was Facebook, right?

36:12 - Joseph Cyriac
  Yeah, because I was here. I think you posted about Tushar, you do recruiting or something, right? Yeah, so like this guy, he's on Upwork and we sat to him and we've worked with a few from my previous company there.  And so I think you guys are in here. did that. And then that was one way I was able to do that.  Reddit, there's, yeah, there's quite a few. So, hey, I got to run guys, okay? So set up the next meeting, let's come up with a plan.  Okay. To kick this model off.

36:59 - Tushar Mangla
  Okay. That's it. So when are you available for the next meeting, I guess, you know, let's do one tomorrow, let's do one tomorrow.  Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. That's good, guys. I appreciate it. All right. Bye bye. All right. Get some sleep.  Yeah. All right. Bye.
