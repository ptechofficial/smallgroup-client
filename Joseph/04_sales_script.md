# Joseph Cyriac - Sales Call Pitch

> **Call Date:** February 13, 2026
> **Prepared for:** Second call with Joseph (follow-up from Feb 12 discovery call)
> **Call Length:** Target 45 minutes
> **Objective:** Close Joseph on Phase 1 engagement in one call, plant the seed for Phase 2

---

## PRE-CALL INTEL (What We Know From Call #1)

Before you open your mouth, remember who Joseph is:

| What We Know | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Solo founder** — just left VeroSkills, branching out on his own | He's bootstrapping. Every dollar matters. But he's also hungry — he's doing outreach every night manually |
| **His pitch converts** — he already closed a contract from manual LinkedIn outreach | The system works. He just needs scale. This is NOT someone who needs to validate his offer |
| **He proved the referral chain** — someone said "wrong person, talk to X" and that turned into a contract | Referrals are his highest-converting channel. Our system automates this |
| **Cost-sensitive** — "cost is important to me as I prove this out" | Don't lead with a $5,000/month number. Show ROI first, then price becomes irrelevant |
| **Found us on Reddit/Facebook** — not a high-ticket inbound lead | He's shopping. He talked to a guy on Upwork from Pakistan. We need to position above "dev shop" immediately |
| **We already built this system for another client** — Apollo + LinkedIn sourcing, LinkedIn connect -> wait -> DM, email with multi-step follow-ups + auto-stop on reply | This is our single biggest credibility card. Use it as PROOF, not a feature list. Drop it in Pillar 2 and the close. |
| **His success metrics**: 20% response rate, 10-12% meeting booking rate | These are reasonable. Our system will exceed them. Use HIS numbers in the pitch |
| **Uses HubSpot** — had sequences at VeroSkills | Familiar with CRM. Not starting from zero |
| **Wants LinkedIn + Email** — already told us his channel preferences | Don't oversell channels he didn't ask for. Give him what he wants, but frame it bigger |

## STEP 1: SET THE FRAME (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Establish authority. Lay out expectations. Plant the close early.

### The Script:

> "Joseph, thanks for jumping back on. Before we dive in, let me lay out how I want to spend the next 45 minutes.
>
> I went deep on your business after our call yesterday. I mapped out the entire construction staffing market — who's hiring electricians, where the decision-makers are, and what it takes to get 10x the pipeline you have today. And I'll be honest — what you described is very close to a system we already built and are running for another client. LinkedIn sourcing, automated outreach, email follow-ups, the whole engine. So this isn't theoretical for us.
>
> Here's how this will go: I'm going to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand where you're headed. Then I'll walk you through exactly what we'd build, phase by phase, with timelines. I'll show you the numbers — real numbers, not hype. And I'll break down what it costs.
>
> At the end, there's really only two outcomes — either this makes sense for where you are and we get moving, or it doesn't and I'll tell you that honestly. I'm not going to waste your time or mine. Sound fair?"

### Why this works:
- **Authority**: "I went deep on your business" — you did the work, you're not winging it
- **Proof planted early**: "We already built and are running this for another client" — this sits in his head for the rest of the call
- **Clear expectations**: He knows what's coming
- **Yes/No frame planted**: "Two outcomes — either it makes sense or it doesn't"
- **Respect for his time**: He's a hustler doing outreach every night. He values efficiency

---

## STEP 2: DISCOVERY — ROLLER COASTER METHOD (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Get Joseph to sell himself on why he needs this. Future state first (where he wants to go) -> current state pain (what's holding him back). By the time you pitch, he's already emotionally committed to the outcome.

### PART A: FUTURE STATE (Start here — get him excited)

> "Joseph, before I show you anything, I want to understand where you're trying to go. Forget the automation for a second.
>
> If we fast-forward 6 months and everything went right — what does your staffing business look like? How many contracts are you closing per month? How many electricians are you placing?"

**Let him talk. Then dig deeper:**

> "And when you say [X contracts/month] — what does that look like in revenue? Ballpark?"

> "Is it just data center electrical, or do you want to expand into other trades? Solar? Plumbing?"

> "Are you planning to stay solo or build a team around this?"

**What you're listening for:**
- His revenue target (even a rough one) — use this in the pitch
- Whether he's thinking small ("maybe 5 contracts") or big ("I want to dominate this space")
- Expansion plans — this seeds Phase 2

### PART B: CURRENT STATE PAIN (Now bring him down to reality)

> "Got it. So that's the goal. Let me ask you this — right now, doing it manually every night, how many people are you actually reaching per week?"

**He'll say something like 20-50. Then:**

> "And out of those, how many turn into actual conversations?"

> "You mentioned on our last call that you got a contract through a referral — someone said 'wrong person, talk to X' — and that turned into a deal. How often does that happen?"

> "So you're doing this every night, manually, after work. How long can you keep that up?"

**What you're doing:** Building the gap between where he wants to be (6 months vision) and where he is (50 manual messages a night, hoping for responses). The bigger the gap, the easier the close.

**The bridge statement:**

> "So here's the gap: you want [his stated goal — e.g., 5-10 contracts/month], but right now you're manually reaching 50 people a week and closing maybe 1 per month. The math doesn't work at this pace. What if I showed you how to reach 2,000+ decision-makers every month — across LinkedIn AND email — without you doing the manual work every night?"

---

## STEP 3: THREE-PILLAR PITCH (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Present the solution in three clear pillars using the PFS framework (Problem → Feature → Solution). Use Joseph's exact language from the call.

### The Setup:

> "Here's what we'd build for you. I'm going to break it into three parts because there are really three problems to solve."

---

### PILLAR 1: "Find Every Decision-Maker Who Needs Electricians"

**Problem** (use his words):
> "You told me yesterday that you're searching LinkedIn manually — typing in 'Director of Construction, data center' — and scrolling through results. That works, but you're limited to whatever LinkedIn shows you in one session. You're also only searching one platform."

**Feature:**
> "What we build is a sourcing engine. We set up LinkedIn Sales Navigator with your exact filters — title, industry, geography, company size — and we use automation tools to pull 500 to 1,000 new leads per week. Every one of them is a Project Manager, Director, VP, or Field Lead at a construction company in the US.
>
> Then we run every lead through an enrichment system that finds their email. Not just one tool — we run a waterfall: Apollo first, then Prospeo, then Hunter, then Dropcontact. First match wins. Instead of finding maybe 50% of emails, we find 70-85%.
>
> That means instead of reaching 50 people a week, you have 500-1,000 verified contacts per week ready for outreach."

**Solution** (his desired outcome):
> "You told me you want new accounts. This is how you fill the top of the funnel — so you're never hunting for people to contact. They're already in your pipeline, verified, and ready to be reached."

---

### PILLAR 2: "Reach Them From Two Directions Without Lifting a Finger"

**Problem** (use his words):
> "Right now you're doing this every night before bed. Connect, send a message, maybe follow up once. And you said yourself — the limit is about 100 connects a week on LinkedIn. That's a ceiling."

**Feature:**
> "We set up two channels running in parallel:
>
> **LinkedIn:** 100 connections per week with a personalized note, automated DMs when they accept, follow-up DMs if they don't respond, and InMail for the highest-value targets who don't accept the connect.
>
> **Email at scale:** We set up 3 sending domains — they look like your business but are separate so your main domain is protected. 9 email accounts total, warmed up over 2 weeks, then ramping to 350-450 cold emails per day. Each lead gets a 7-touch sequence over 30 days — not just one email and hope. Seven different angles: direct pitch, short follow-up, case study, pain point, referral ask, proof, and a breakup email.
>
> The data shows most replies come on touches 3 through 7. Right now you're doing touch 1, maybe touch 2. You're leaving 80% of your responses on the table."

**PROOF DROP** (this is where you show it's real — not a slide deck):

> "And Joseph — this isn't a proposal I'm reading off a page. We already built this exact system for a client. Here's what it does right now:
>
> It finds leads from Apollo and LinkedIn automatically. On the LinkedIn side, it sends the connection request, waits for them to accept, then sends the DM — hands-free. On the email side, it sends the first email, runs the follow-up sequence, and stops automatically the moment someone replies — no more than 3 follow-ups if there's no response, so you never spam anyone.
>
> The engine already exists. For your business, we customize the targeting — data center construction, those exact titles you showed me yesterday — we write the messaging in your voice, and we plug it into your HubSpot. But the system? It's built. It's running. This isn't starting from scratch."

**[If you have any numbers from that client — response rates, leads sourced, meetings booked — add them here:]**

> "For that client, we're pulling [X leads/week] and seeing [Y% response rate / Z meetings booked]. Your market is different, but the mechanics are identical."

**[If you don't have numbers yet, skip the above line. The "it's built and running" proof is strong enough on its own.]**

---

**Solution** (his desired outcome):
> "You said you want 20% response rate and 10-12% booking a meeting. With a 7-touch sequence across two channels, we're targeting 140 to 270 responses per month and 18 to 35 meetings booked. You told me yesterday that even a few contracts a month is a win — this system is designed to deliver 4 to 7."

**Use his numbers:**
> "You said 10-12% meeting rate is a win. At 2,000-2,500 outreach per month, that's 200-300 responses and 20-30 meetings. Even at half that — you're at 10-15 meetings. That's already 3x what you're doing manually."

---

### PILLAR 3: "Never Miss a Response or Referral Again"

**Problem** (use his exact story):
> "You told me the best story yesterday — you messaged someone, they said 'I'm the wrong person, talk to this guy,' and that referral turned into a contract. That's your highest-converting channel. But right now, tracking those referrals is manual. What happens when you're getting 100-200 responses a month instead of 10?"

**Feature:**
> "Everything flows into HubSpot — which you already use. But we add an intelligence layer on top:
>
> When someone responds, our system classifies it automatically — interested, not now, wrong person, or unsubscribe. If they say 'talk to Sarah in procurement,' the system extracts Sarah's name and company, finds her email and LinkedIn, creates a new lead tagged as a referral, and pings you on WhatsApp within minutes: 'Referral received — call Sarah Johnson at ABC Construction, she handles staffing contracts. Here's her email and LinkedIn.'
>
> You pick up the phone and close. That's your job. Everything before that — we handle."

**Solution** (his desired outcome):
> "You told me the referral chain is how you closed your first contract. Imagine that happening 5x, 10x per month — and never missing one because it was buried in your LinkedIn inbox at 2am."

---

## STEP 4: PHASE 2 TEASE (3 minutes)

**Goal:** Don't sell Phase 2 now. Plant the seed so he sees the vision — and so he knows working with you is a long-term play, not a one-time project.

> "Joseph, that's Phase 1. And I want to be straight with you — Phase 1 alone will transform your pipeline. But here's what gets me excited about Phase 2, once this is running.
>
> Right now we're sourcing from LinkedIn only. But do you know where your buyers actually hang out beyond LinkedIn?"

**Pause. Let him think.**

> "We've mapped 30+ platforms where construction decision-makers spend time. Job boards like Indeed, Trade Hounds, ConstructionJobs — where companies are literally posting 'Hiring electricians for data center project.' Those are the warmest leads on the planet because they're advertising that they need what you sell TODAY.
>
> Beyond that: industry directories like the ENR Top 400 — the 400 largest construction firms in America. The AGC with 33,000 member firms. Project bid databases like ConstructConnect where we can see who just won a $50M data center contract — and reach out before they even post a job.
>
> Reddit communities where PMs are complaining about labor shortages. Trade shows where every attendee is your buyer. We even found vendor matching platforms where GCs are actively looking for staffing subs.
>
> And in Phase 2, we don't just pitch electricians — we expand to plumbers, HVAC, and other skilled trades. Same system, broader market.
>
> But that's down the road. Phase 1 first. Prove the machine, then scale it."

**Why this works:**
- Shows you've done massive research (authority)
- Creates a vision of what's possible (future state)
- But doesn't overwhelm — "Phase 1 first" keeps it focused
- Makes him feel like he's getting the long-term partner, not a one-time vendor

---

## STEP 5: PRICING & TIMELINE (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Value stack first. Then drop the price. Then silence.

### Timeline First (Build Urgency):

> "Let me walk you through the timeline because I know you want to start seeing results fast.
>
> **Week 1:** We set up everything — your sending domains, email accounts, Sales Navigator connection, enrichment tools, HubSpot pipeline. We start warming up the email accounts immediately. This runs on autopilot for 14 days.
>
> **Week 2:** While emails are warming up, we build your lead lists and outreach sequences. The 7-touch email funnel, your LinkedIn messages, the response handling workflows. We also pull your first batch of 500-1,000 leads.
>
> **Week 3:** LinkedIn outreach goes live — 20 connections per day. Email starts at low volume — 10-15 per account per day. You start seeing responses.
>
> **Week 4:** Email ramps to full volume. LinkedIn at full speed. Job board monitoring live. The machine is running.
>
> By the end of month 1, you're reaching 2,000+ people. By month 2, you should be booking 15-30 meetings per month. You told me you want new accounts — this is the engine that delivers them."

### Value Stack (Before Price):

> "So for everything included — here's what you're getting:
>
> - Complete infrastructure: 3 domains, 9 email accounts, all warmed up and configured
> - LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration with automated sourcing
> - Email enrichment that finds 70-85% of contacts (not the 50% you'd get on your own)
> - 7-touch email sequence professionally written and loaded
> - LinkedIn outreach: automated connects, DMs, follow-ups
> - Response classification — interested, referral, not now — all handled automatically
> - Referral detection that finds the new contact and pings you on WhatsApp
> - HubSpot pipeline fully configured
> - Weekly reporting so you know exactly what's working"

### The Tool Costs (Separate First — Anchor Low):

> "First, the tools. These are third-party subscriptions you'd own directly — regardless of which option you go with:
>
> - LinkedIn Sales Navigator: ~$100/month
> - Phantombuster: ~$69/month
> - Clay: ~$149/month
> - Instantly.ai: ~$30/month
> - Email accounts: ~$54/month
> - Domains: ~$3/month
> - Email verification: ~$30/month
> - N8N hosting: ~$20/month
>
> Total tool cost: roughly $455 to $505 per month. You own all of it. Even if you stop working with us tomorrow, you keep the entire infrastructure."

### Two Options (Present Both — Let Him Choose):

> "Now for our side, I want to give you two options. Because I know you said you want to prove this out, and I want to respect that."

**Option 1 — Present first (the anchor):**

> "**Option 1: We build the entire system and hand it to you. One-time fee: $3,500.**
>
> That includes everything I just walked you through — the full infrastructure setup, the lead sourcing automation, the email sequences, the LinkedIn outreach workflows, the response handling, the HubSpot pipeline. We build it, we test it, we train you on how to run it, and we give you 2 weeks of support after handoff.
>
> After that, you run the machine yourself. You'd log into the tools, pull your lead lists, monitor responses, adjust sequences. It works — but it means you're spending time operating the system each week instead of just closing deals."

**Option 2 — Present second (the recommended):**

> "**Option 2: We build it AND we run it for you. $1,500 per month, 6-month commitment.**
>
> Same full build — but we don't hand it off. We manage the lead sourcing every week. We run your LinkedIn outreach. We manage your email sequences. We handle response classification. When a referral comes in, we find the contact and ping you. You get a weekly report showing exactly what's working.
>
> Your only job is picking up the phone when we send you a hot lead and closing the deal. That's it.
>
> The 6-month commitment is because the system needs runway — email warm-up alone takes 3-4 weeks, and we don't hit full volume until month 2. Anything shorter doesn't give the machine enough time to prove itself."

**[SILENCE. Let him process. Do not fill the gap.]**

### The Comparison (Only If He Asks or Hesitates):

> "Let me put it this way:
>
> | | Option 1: One-Time Build | Option 2: Managed (Recommended) |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Our fee** | $3,500 (once) | $1,500/month (6-month min = $9,000) |
> | **Tool costs** | ~$500/month (you pay either way) | ~$500/month (you pay either way) |
> | **Total cost, 6 months** | $3,500 + $3,000 tools = **$6,500** | $9,000 + $3,000 tools = **$12,000** |
> | **Who runs the system** | You — every week | Us — you just close deals |
> | **Your time commitment** | 5-10 hours/week operating the machine | 0 hours — we send you leads, you take meetings |
> | **What happens if something breaks** | You troubleshoot | We fix it |
> | **Ongoing optimization** | You figure it out | We A/B test sequences, adjust targeting, improve weekly |
>
> The question is really: do you want to spend 5-10 hours a week running the system, or do you want to spend that time closing contracts?"

### The ROI Math (Use For Either Option):

> "Joseph, your staffing contracts are $10,000 to $50,000 each. With Option 1, one single contract pays for the entire build plus a year of tools. With Option 2, one contract per month covers the entire system 5 to 25 times over. You closed one contract from manual outreach doing 50 messages a night. This system does 2,500 per month. The ROI math isn't even close."

---

## STEP 6: CLOSE (5 minutes)

### 6A: Exhaust All Questions

> "What questions do you have about either option?"

**Answer every single question. Do not rush. Do not re-pitch. Let him ask until he says "I think I'm good" or "No more questions."**

### 6B: Get Alignment

> "Cool. Let me ask you this — based on everything we just walked through, do you feel like this system would get you to those [X contracts/month] you mentioned?"

**You need a clear YES. If he gives a wishy-washy "I think so" — dig in:**

> "What part are you unsure about? Let me address that."

### 6C: Yes or No Frame

> "Joseph, I know there's usually three things someone can say at this point — yes let's do it, no it's not for me, or 'let me think about it.' And I want you to know I'm completely fine with a no. The one I want to avoid is the 'let me think about it' — because in my experience that usually just means there's a question I didn't answer. So can we keep it to a yes or a no?"

### 6D: Assume the Close

**If he picks Option 2 (managed — this is the goal):**

> "Smart move. Next steps are simple — I'll send you the agreement today. Once that's signed, we start setting up your domains and infrastructure tomorrow. You'll be live within 3-4 weeks, and you don't have to touch anything except your phone when meetings start coming in. Sound good?"

**If he picks Option 1 (one-time build):**

> "Done. I'll send the agreement today. Once signed, we start building immediately. We'll have you fully set up and trained within 3-4 weeks. And if down the road you want us to take over management so you can focus purely on closing — that option's always there."

**(Seed the retainer upgrade — many one-time build clients upgrade within 2-3 months when they realize running the machine is work.)**

**If he says he needs to think about it (despite the frame):**

> "No problem. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the investment, the approach, or which option to go with? Let's talk through it now so you have everything you need to make a decision."

**If it's specifically about Option 1 vs Option 2:**

> "Tell you what — if you're torn between the two, go with Option 1. Lower commitment, you get the full system, and if you decide later that you'd rather have us manage it, we can switch to the retainer model anytime. Fair?"

**(This is the 'downsell to save the deal' play. A $3,500 close today is better than a 'let me think about it' that turns into ghosting. And once he's in, the upgrade to managed is natural.)**

**If he says no:**

> "Totally respect that. Can I ask what the main concern is? Just so I know for my own learning."

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "It's too expensive / I need to keep costs low"

> "I hear you — you mentioned cost is important as you prove this out. That's exactly why I gave you two options. Option 1 is $3,500 one time — one single contract pays for the entire system plus a year of tools. You're doing 50 messages a night manually right now. If your time is worth even $50/hour, you're already spending $1,500+ a month in sweat equity. This replaces that AND reaches 50x more people. The question isn't whether you can afford it — it's whether you can afford to keep doing 50 messages a night for the next 6 months."

### "I want to start small / just test it"

> "That's exactly what this is. Phase 1 is the test — LinkedIn sourcing only, 3 email domains, prove the numbers work. And if you want the smallest commitment possible, Option 1 is a one-time $3,500 build. You own everything. If the numbers work, we scale to Phase 2 together. If they don't, you still have the entire infrastructure. I'm not asking you to commit to the full vision today — just Phase 1."

### "I talked to someone on Upwork who can do it cheaper"

> "For sure — there are people who'll set up a Phantombuster script for $200. But here's the difference: we already have this system built and running for a client right now. LinkedIn sourcing, automated connects, DMs, email follow-ups that stop on reply — it's live, not a promise. On top of that, the Upwork guy isn't building you the multi-domain email infrastructure, the 7-touch sequence strategy, the response classification, the referral detection, the HubSpot integration, or the ongoing optimization. You can buy the plumbing cheap. What you're paying for with us is a proven engine that's already generating results — customized for your market."

### "Can I just buy the tools and do it myself?"

> "Absolutely. I can hand you the tool list right now. But here's the reality — we've already built this system, debugged it, and have it running live. You'd be spending the next 2-3 months figuring out Phantombuster, Clay, Instantly, and N8N on your own. Meanwhile, you're still doing 50 messages a night. Or — we plug you into a system that's already proven, and you're booking meetings in 3 weeks. Which gets you to new accounts faster?"

---

## POST-CALL ACTIONS

**If he closes:**
1. Send agreement within 2 hours
2. Send "Welcome" email with Week 1 checklist (what he needs to provide: domain preferences, LinkedIn credentials, HubSpot access, pitch messaging)
3. Buy domains same day and start warm-up

**If he asks for time:**
1. Send a follow-up email within 1 hour summarizing the three pillars and the numbers
2. Include a one-page comparison: "Manual vs. System" showing his current metrics vs. projected
3. Set a specific follow-up time: "I'll ping you tomorrow at [time] — does that work?"
4. Do NOT send the full strategy document — that's your leverage

**If he says no:**
1. Thank him
2. Offer to reconnect in 30 days: "If you change your mind or want to revisit, I'm here"
3. Move on — every hour on a "no" is an hour not spent on a "yes"

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Do NOT lead with tools or features.** Lead with HIS goals, HIS numbers, HIS words from the first call. The tools are how — he's buying the what (contracts, revenue, pipeline).

2. **Use his exact language.** He said "new accounts," "response rate," "prove it out," "automate." Mirror these back.

3. **The referral story is your anchor.** He told you the most powerful case study himself — someone said "wrong person, talk to X" and it turned into a contract. Use this story 2-3 times during the pitch. It's HIS proof that the system works.

4. **Don't over-explain the tech.** He doesn't care about Phantombuster vs. Heyreach. He cares about: how many people will I reach, how many will respond, and how fast can it start.

5. **He's comparing you to a $200 Upwork freelancer.** Your job is to make that comparison feel absurd by the end of the call. Not by trashing the freelancer — by showing the depth of what you've already built and have running live.

6. **Cost sensitivity is real but solvable.** He's solo, bootstrapping. But he also knows one contract is $10K-$50K. Frame every cost against that number.

7. **Phase 2 is the retention play.** Even if he doesn't care about it today, planting the seed means he sees you as a long-term partner, not a one-time vendor. That changes how he evaluates the price.

8. **"We already built this" is your killer line.** You mention it three times: once in the frame ("this isn't theoretical"), once in Pillar 2 (the full proof drop with specifics), and once in objection handling (vs. Upwork / DIY). Three touches — plants it, proves it, reinforces it. Don't overuse it beyond that or it sounds desperate.
