**Subject:** Tomorrow's Call - Here's What We're Building for You

---

Hi Joseph,

Great talking today. Your pitch clearly works - the manual outreach you've been doing every night is proof. The problem is reach, not message.

So here's what we're going to walk you through tomorrow - a system designed to put thousands of construction decision-makers into your pipeline, not just the 50-100 you can reach by hand.

**1. The Market Opportunity**
We'll pull up your exact ICP live - Project Managers, Directors, Field Leads in data center construction across the US - and show you how big the addressable market actually is. We'll also show you something we think is a game-changer: companies that are actively posting jobs for electricians right now. These are the warmest possible leads because they literally need what you sell today.

**2. Multi-Channel Outreach System**
We'll walk through how we hit prospects from two directions:
- **LinkedIn:** Automated connection requests, DMs, and follow-ups (within LinkedIn's limits)
- **Email at Scale:** Multiple sending domains with warm-up, so you're reaching 300-500+ people per day by email - not 10-20

We'll show you the exact 7-touch follow-up funnel we'd run - each email takes a different angle (direct pitch, social proof, pain point, referral ask, case study, breakup). Industry data shows most replies come on touches 3-7, and right now you're only doing 1-2.

**3. Finding Emails That Actually Work**
We'll demo how we use waterfall enrichment (Clay) to find 70-85% of emails for your lead list, compared to ~50% from a single tool like Apollo. More found emails = more people you can reach.

**4. What Happens When They Respond**
The part you care most about - how responses get to you instantly, how referrals get auto-tracked (like the "wrong person, talk to X" scenario), and how everything flows into HubSpot so nothing falls through the cracks.

**5. Pricing & Timeline**
We'll break down the tool costs, our service options, and what the realistic timeline looks like to go from zero to leads hitting your inbox.

If there's anything else you'd like us to cover, let me know.

Talk tomorrow,
Prakarsh
