# SERVICE PROPOSAL

**Lead Generation & Outreach Automation**

---

**Prepared by:** Small Group
**Prepared for:** Joseph Cyriac
**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Proposal valid until:** February 19, 2026

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

This proposal outlines the scope, deliverables, timeline, and investment for a fully managed lead generation and outreach automation system — designed specifically for Joseph Cyriac's construction staffing business.

Small Group will build, deploy, and continuously manage an automated pipeline that sources qualified decision-makers in the data center construction space and reaches them through LinkedIn and email — so Joseph can focus entirely on closing deals.

---

## 2. OBJECTIVES

- Replace manual LinkedIn outreach with an automated multi-channel system
- Source 500–1,000 verified leads per week from the data center construction industry
- Run LinkedIn + email outreach in parallel with multi-touch sequences
- Automatically classify and route responses to streamline follow-up
- Configure HubSpot as the central pipeline for all lead activity
- Continuously iterate on targeting, messaging, and funneling strategies to improve conversion rates

---

## 3. SCOPE OF WORK

### Month 1 — System Build & Launch

#### 3.1 Lead Sourcing Engine

- Configure LinkedIn Sales Navigator with precision filters (titles, industries, geographies, company size) targeting Project Managers, Directors, VPs, and Field Leads at data center construction companies across the US
- Set up automated lead extraction to pull 500–1,000 new contacts per week
- Build an email enrichment waterfall (multi-provider verification) to achieve 70–85% email match rate on sourced leads
- Establish deduplication and list hygiene processes to maintain data quality

#### 3.2 Email Outreach Infrastructure

- Procure and configure 3 dedicated sending domains (separate from the client's primary domain to protect sender reputation)
- Set up 9 email accounts across those domains
- Execute a 2–3 week email warm-up and ramp-up process
- Ramp to 350–450 cold emails per day at full volume

#### 3.3 Email Sequences

- Write and deploy a 7-touch email sequence over 30 days per lead, including:
  - Direct pitch
  - Short follow-up
  - Case study / proof angle
  - Pain point angle
  - Referral ask
  - Social proof
  - Breakup email
- Configure auto-stop on reply — sequences halt the moment a prospect responds

#### 3.4 LinkedIn Outreach Automation

- Automate 100 connection requests per week with personalized notes
- Set up automated DMs triggered on connection acceptance
- Configure follow-up DMs for non-responders
- Set up InMail sequences for high-value targets who don't accept connection requests

#### 3.5 Response Handling

- Build an automated response classification system:
  - **Interested** — flagged for immediate follow-up
  - **Not Right Now** — tagged and queued for future re-engagement
  - **Wrong Person** — logged with any referral information
  - **Unsubscribe** — removed from all sequences automatically
- Route classified responses into HubSpot with appropriate tags and pipeline stages

#### 3.6 HubSpot Pipeline Configuration

- Configure deal stages aligned to the outreach funnel (New Lead → Contacted → Responded → Meeting Booked → Contract)
- Set up contact properties, tags, and views for managing inbound responses
- Integrate outreach data so all lead activity is visible in one place

---

### Month 2 Onward — Iteration & Expansion

Starting from the second month, the focus shifts to:

1. **Strategy Iteration**
   - A/B test email sequences (subject lines, copy, send times, follow-up cadence)
   - A/B test LinkedIn messaging (connection notes, DM copy, InMail scripts)
   - Adjust targeting criteria based on response data (refine titles, industries, company sizes)
   - Analyze conversion metrics at each funnel stage and optimize for drop-off points

2. **Additional System Development (Phase 2 Scoping)**
   - Explore and build sourcing from additional platforms beyond LinkedIn (job boards, industry directories, bid databases)
   - Expand targeting to adjacent trades (plumbing, HVAC, other skilled trades) as opportunity arises
   - Build new automation workflows based on learnings from Phase 1

3. **Ongoing Management**
   - Weekly lead sourcing managed by Small Group
   - LinkedIn + email outreach operated and monitored by Small Group
   - Response classification and routing maintained by Small Group
   - Weekly performance reports delivered to the client

---

## 4. PROJECTED RESULTS

Based on conservative industry benchmarks and the client's own metrics:

| Metric | Monthly Projection |
|---|---|
| People reached | 3,000+ |
| Responses | 150–280 |
| Meetings booked | 15–25 |
| New contracts | 3–5 |

*Based on a 5–8% response rate across LinkedIn + email combined. Actual results depend on market conditions, messaging quality, and offer strength — all of which Small Group will continuously optimize.*

## 5. TIMELINE

| Phase | Timeframe | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Infrastructure Setup** | Week 1 | Sending domains purchased, email accounts created, Sales Navigator configured, HubSpot pipeline set up. Email warm-up begins. |
