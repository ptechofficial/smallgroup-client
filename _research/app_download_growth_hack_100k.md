00:00:40
for those who are not familiar new to the channel welcome but we've served over 3,000 probably at this point 4,000 apps from just the 12 years that we've been doing this since 2013 and 14 range and so here's some of the great companies we've got to work with a lot of great interviews that we've had through the years and then let's get into why you're really here all right here we go now the setup I want to make this super simple so if you want to take a picture of this do it now here we go

00:01:09
here is the exact process that you have to follow the first thing we're going to do is add a ratings prompt to your first time user experience why because we know that most people who buy buy during that first time user experience and we want to add that ratings prompt during that first time user experience as well now you can wait to that second time as well because Apple's figuring things out so I'm not going to share with you specifically when to do it you're going to have to join our app Masters Academy

00:01:35
to figure that out but just try to do a ratings prompt either on the first time user experience or the second open the very time okay next do ASO I won't teach you how to do ASO here but do ASO for your app the next thing we're going to do is make a lifetime offer for free okay bear with me in the next video I'll show you why this is so valuable and lastly we're going to tell appid advice or in the app Santa that we're making our lifetime for free cuz obviously we need to get promotion for this

00:02:08
particular discount and two days later we're going to make it back to full price and I'll show you how to do all that in an upcoming video all right so let's get to it here's what's happened by following this exact strategy that's why I said take a screenshot because you're about to see the exact numbers that happened after we did this so here's the app advice now there's Indie app Santa as well but I'm going to show you the app advice it's very simple to

00:02:30
do you go to appadvice.com apps gone free and I'll put all those important links into the YouTube description so here are the numbers this is one of my favorite case studies of 2024 we drove 106,000 downloads now this is an AI app that has cost but he's willing to listen to me and make his lifetime offer for free so we created $150 lifetime offer for those who are watching not familiar with this it has to be a non-consumable Ina purchase it should not be a subscription destion has to be under

00:03:01
non-consumable in app purchase and I'll walk you through that in part two of this video all right we set it free we told app advice that we're going free for the $150 lifetime offer we drove 106,000 downloads just imagine how much you would have to pay to get to 106,000 downloads put that number in your head because most people think oh I don't want to give my lifetime for free uh how much again all right and the server cost for this particular app $11,000 so we paid $11,000 in server cost to get $

00:03:36
106,000 downloads and 800 new ratings 200 in the US 600 worldwide and made $77,000 within the first month now as you can see almost right when we ran the app advice campaign on January 9th we had a little bit of bump here we were starting to see an increase in sales that is the whole point of the app advice campaign it is to hack the downloads Drive thousands of downloads give the new ASO a kickart so that you can start ranking well for some keywords because part of the algorithm involves download velocity that's why we were

00:04:14
able to generate sales because we were able to generate more downloads and get higher keyword rankings so how was he doing that $77,000 look it before he worked with us he was just making a few hundred a month now why I love this case study is he hired us around mid December maybe at the end of December and I said hey here's what I want to do you want to just listen to me he said let's do it Steve okay he said Steve should I run Apple search ads at this moment I said you have five ratings and I just don't

00:04:45
think that it's the time and you're barely making any money so why continue to spend more money driving downloads with just five ratings let's try this growth hack and let's see what happens so he listened to me and it worked beautifully now you can be asking yourself Steve you made 7,000 congratulations that first month what happened why are the sales going down and I say well Robert it's not going down it's actually going up so you can see the sales by Source type is blue is

00:05:14
App Store search that's organic free downloads by the way so his sales in that first month when he ran the campaign he was able to get sales in the green line which is the app advice campaign remember we only made it free for 2 days so a lot of people missed out on the deal and came in said hey this is a pretty darn cool AI app let me just pay for the stinking app and that's why we drove $3,000 of sales within the first three months through app refer so it works as well remember app refer

00:05:47
right so we spent $1,000 on server costs free 106,000 downloads made $3,000 from that Source type and now we're rocking and rolling so his our free organic downloads have gone up now this was back in January what's happening now look at this we've made over $70,000 almost $70,000 for this app and in September and August we made over $10,000 so now this is now a sixf fig business with this growth ha duh all right now here's what happened with our app and I want to give you the differences between India apppp

00:06:25
Santa and app advice so for our app we ran an app advice campaign that drove about 10,000 downloads and this is just 6,000 but the next day we did 4,000 and then we did Indi app Santa same lifetime offer for free we drove 13,000 downloads what you can do is app advice is free so go ahead and run it on app advice first and then because app advice you're going to have to wait and if you're not going to be patient to wait another I forget what the timeline is but if you don't want to wait you can just pay India app

00:06:55
Santa for some promotions doing the same promo and in this casee sometimes India app Santa will drive more downloads than even app advice so keep that in mind that this is something that you can do frequently and we have done this with this app we've done it multiple times on app advice we've done it on Indi app Santa as well now I want to give you a more reasonable case study all right so here's another app that we did the same exact strategy on and we made $11,200 so over $11,000 within the first

00:07:23
month since running the app advice campaign that same growth hack right so it works remember the this percentage only 177% 17 17% of all apps in the app space make at least $11,000 you want to get to your $1,000 run this growth app right now and stay tuned for our next video where I'll share with you how do you make your lifetime offer for free what's the best way to run Indie apppp Sienna campaigns and so much more so stay subscribed if you haven't hit subscribe make sure you hit subscribe
