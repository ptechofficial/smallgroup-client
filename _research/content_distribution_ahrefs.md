00:00:00
camera is on microphone is working special effects wait a second okay yeah we can start the show hi my name is Tim Soulo and you're watching the very first episode of SaaS Marketing Vlog where I'm going to share what's going on in Ahrefs marketing department what keeps us busy what we're struggling with and what we're successful bit so basically this is the very first episode I have my notes in here so I'll be picking from time to time I hope it's not a problem for you and to be honest with you I don't really

00:00:49
have any idea of how this series would unfold or even the format of this series will be just sitting here and speaking to you or will be take camera with us whenever we go to conferences or will we take the camera with us whenever we're doing some meetings or discussions I don't really know but I figured out that the actual idea of SaaS Marketing Vlog where I'm sharing on video what is happening might be interesting to people so please be giving me some feedback and I will adjust the series accordingly now you may be wondering why did I launch

00:01:20
this vlog anyway why I'm sitting here in front of the camera and talking to you it's all about content distribution and this is the keyword that is going to be in the title of this video how content distribution works right now here at Ahrefs so first of all we have our blog where we're after the SEO traffic the traffic from Google so whenever people are searching for anything related to SEO in Google we want to rank our articles there we want people to find us in Google whenever they're searching for any related SEO issues the other channel

00:01:52
that I've started that I've started using not too long ago is Medium so Medium is another platform and while at our blog we're going after topics that have search traffic potential that people are actively searching for in Google on Medium Medium allows me to write about anything just speak my mind on any topic whether it has any surge demand in Google or whether it has not because Medium first of all they have the so called publications which have a lot of following so I am publishing my articles in a publication called The Startup

00:02:23
which immediately exposes whatever I write to a lot of followers of that publication but not only that Medium has their internal algorithm of suggesting relevant articles to people and they also have on their home page a selection of trending articles etc etc etc so if you have really original thoughts really interesting content your content may kind of go viral on Medium and give you a lot of exposure so this is our second channel of how we reaching people with our content another channel that I'm

00:02:54
also actively investing my time my personal time right now is podcast interview so a lot of people including myself are listening to podcasts this is why I started actively pitching myself to be a guest on different podcasts let me just give you a link to to the latest one if you're interested and this is yet another way for us to reach people with our content so that's three content distribution methods already first is SEO whenever people whenever people search for us in Google second Medium for people who are Medium readers who

00:03:25
are hanging out on that platform looking for interesting articles to read third podcasts then obviously conferences I won't go much into it because if because it's obvious we're involved sometimes as speakers sometimes as exhibitors and finally YouTube before that I was mainly talking about text content and audio content well except for conferences which is like involves all your senses now let's talk about video so there's YouTube is a huge platform where you can get a lot of exposure and actually we already have YouTube channel

00:03:58
which I've started like shortly after I joined Ahrefs and I was recording myself on my iPhone 5 and then upgraded to GoPro so and actually it like those videos were embarrassing let me embed just one of them I recorded I think 20 episodes of what I called "Oversimplified SEO" show and then we hired our amazing Sam Oh who took over and who's now producing all those SEO tutorials for us Sam is not allowing me to post these videos with my ramblings on which is now his YouTube channel with his instructional SEO videos which is

00:04:35
why I had to launch this other channel but Sam I'm sorry but if you look at the top 5 videos on our original h.res YouTube channel sorted by the amount of I'm still there you you still haven't surpassed my most watched video I'm sorry Sam try and you will succeed okay so originally with this channel I actually was hoping to be kind of efficient and those articles that I'm publishing on Medium with some of our thoughts on marketing with some of our thoughts on productivity team-building etc etc I thought that I would just sit

00:05:11
in front of the camera and talk about the same things that I publish on Medium but the problem was that I was hoping that I can launch a YouTube channel which would grow in following so people would actually subscribe to channel and look forward to subsequent videos please subscribe if you like what's happening so far if you liked the thing that I'm sharing I figured out that if I will simply be what is called repurposing my Medium articles into videos one super important thing won't be met they won't have a plotline behind

00:05:45
them because on Medium I'm publishing on super random topics because I don't care about like my I have no goal of keeping the same audience with me from one article to another I don't care if people will subscribe or not because I know that I'm publishing within the publication that has following already and they know that people go on and off for Medium and they just look for headlines that are interesting to them with YouTube I I'm hoping to generate some following and this is why I figured that the crucial the critical thing for

00:06:16
these YouTube videos videos is to have a plot line so that for you guys it would be interesting to follow what like our progress the progress of our marketing department from video to video so this is why I decided that instead of publishing on this YouTube channel videos of our random thoughts about marketing like I'm doing on Medium or random SEO tutorials like we're doing on our blog and on our other YouTube channel I'd rather just simply share with you what is happening in our marketing department Ahrefs is a SaaS

00:06:48
company we have less than 50 people in our entire team our marketing department is 10 people right now I think now here will be the actual number I'm sorry guys if I didn't count so yeah I figured that for some people who are running SaaS companies whether they're smaller than us or whether they're bigger than us you guys might be interested to follow our journey and we are happy to share what is happening what is happening in our marketing department and share it within a timeline so that it has storyline so

00:07:19
that you guys can follow and see how it is working for us over time so consider this to be a very long intro to the actual content of the episode but I feel that the thought process behind launching this channel is actually part of the vlog so let me talk about email list building because this is something that we were ignoring for quite a long time on our blog here's a fun story the other day I get a message in Linkedin from a person a guy telling me that he's been following a travel blog for quite a while for like half a year or something

00:07:53
and he had a question to me like as a marketer to marketer why on Ahrefs blog we were not trying to get his email address why don't we have any lead magnets why don't we have any like pop-up SUBSCRIBE forms etc etc so what I did I copy pasted the name of the guy I went to our Intercom which is our CRM slash support slash chat software I found the guy he had an active account with us so I knew his email address i copied email address and pasted it back to him and he said okay now I understand so you didn't try to

00:08:26
turn me into a lead you didn't try to turn me into an email subscriber of your blog because right from your content you were able to persuade me to actually sign up for Ahrefs and become your customer other than quote-unquote lead That strategy worked for us pretty well because in our content we actually try to convert people into customers via showcasing the use cases of our software within our content but we do want to grow our audience we do want to have a list of people who are waiting for our articles so that whenever we

00:09:00
publish something new we had an audience of people who are expecting new content from us and we're looking forward to getting those emails so we did have a pretty large subscribe form at the end of the articles but we figured that people are not seeing the form because even though it was big and bold it visually marked the end of the article and whenever my teammates ask me why don't we use those like pop-ups in your face and lead magnets because they are so effective everyone knows that once you install a

00:09:31
pop-up your email subscription rate will go up but we don't do this at Ahrefs blog because like I said previously in the episode in this episode our goal is to rank for keywords that we're covering in our articles so whenever think about it whenever a person searches for something in Google they have a problem that they want to solve and they land on our blog and we have a perfect article to solve their problem and like I said within that article we're actually teaching them how to solve their problem with the help of Ahrefs so

00:10:03
effectively our article is basically a sales page for our tool which is tailored to the actual specific issue that a person was searching for in Google so why would we interrupt their experience with any pop-up or offering them lead magnet and take them somewhere away from reading an article which is basically a sales pitch which will probably and most likely convert them to users of our software so this is why we were kind of neglecting building our email list and what we did we replaced that form at the very end of the article

00:10:34
with a slide in form that that slides in pretty much when you scroll to the very end of the article which means that you've read article to the end and still we're not offering any freebies we don't want to trick people into our list we don't want to trick people into getting an e-book and then spam them with our articles if they don't need it so what the pop-up says is enjoyed the article then consider signing up to to get the new ones to your email address the performance of that pop-up is actually not too bad

00:11:02
let me post the actual CTR and clicks numbers on a separate slide because I don't have right now with me but so far we're happy with it one other interesting thing about our email list is that recently we stopped tracking the open rates and the clicks on the emails that we send to our blog subscribers so the thought process behind it is simple actually shout-out to guys from Pitchbox Alex Michael I was in January I was at traffic think tank conference where I was hanging out with guys from Pitchbox this is

00:11:41
outreach software and what they said if I'm not mistaken they said that within their platform they don't even have the technical functionality to track opens and clicks because they believe that whenever you put those tracking codes in the in the email it is easier for email service providers for Gmail Hotmail etc etc to figure out that your email is either spam spam or some kind of promotional email because whenever people send emails to each other they don't really include any tracking scripts for opens and clicks so we

00:12:13
figured out that we don't really (like Ahrefs marketing department) we don't really care about the open rates of our emails we don't really care about the click rates because you just dispatch an email with the latest articles and that's it like it doesn't matter what's the open rate it doesn't matter what the click rate we still trying to do a good job with our content we're still trying to write great subject lines right like short and unintrusive copy to to promote this article so yeah it doesn't really change

00:12:43
anything for us we were tracking open rates and click rates for quite a while and we never did any actionable marketing decisions based on those numbers so we decided that we just discontinued tracking them in favor hoping that the open rates and the click rates the deliverability of emails will actually improve because we don't have those tracking scripts in the emails and therefore we'll actually get more opens and more clicks than we used to get when we try to track this and one final thing that I want to share in this episode

00:13:13
hope it won't get long I will try to keep episodes under two 20 minutes so that not to overwhelm you with content and not over bore you with my ramblings but the final thing that we're doing we're trying to educate the customers of our software within the actual software it might sound like a no-brainer like Duh, everyone is doing that but whenever I meet with our customers on different conferences or like do Skype calls with them and whenever I showcase different features especially new features to them they they don't

00:13:44
know like a lot of the functionality that we have in our tool and I'm pretty sure it's common for a lot of SaaS companies so I was continuously asking our customers question like how do you want us to better educate you on all the awesome tools and features that we have in Ahrefs do we invite you to a webinar do you open our emails should we like do that at conferences from from from the stage etc etc and so far none of our customers was able to give me a definitive answer to the question of how to better educate them on using our

00:14:16
software so then we figured out that we have the site audit tool where we crawl your entire website and we show you the SEO issues that are potentially hurting the performance of your website in Google and what what was happening in that site audit tool so we had over a hundred pre-configured SEO issues and for each SEO issue we don't only report that like you have redirects or you have like duplicated title tags etc etc for every issue that we report with your website we had like a question mark button which which you

00:14:52
can press and see what the issue is all about and how to fix it so once I started using the Site Audit myself and like digging into the reports and issues and how to fix them I realized that it is incredibly useful and a lot of our customers were actually asking us to expand on these descriptions these issue descriptions because they were getting a lot of value out of it because the actual tool was educating them to use that though so they didn't need to go to youtube they didn't need to read our blog to learn about the specific issues

00:15:23
that they were seeing in their interface so we figured out if we have that amazing education integrated into site audit tool why don't we do that with all our other tools that we have in Ahrefs so right now we're testing the how to use button which we have in for reports in Site Explorer we have it on over a new report we have it on I believe referring domains or backlinks report on organic keywords report and I think Top Pages I may be wrong with the report that I've named we have created pretty detailed tutorials

00:15:53
of how how to use each of these reports and we have a button how to use it so right now let me also paste the statistics here of the click-through rate of these how to use buttons but so far what we understood is that people are actually clicking them people are actually reading those descriptions so they are helpful and we're looking forward to actually adding videos because some people don't like to read through like big chunks of text so they would rather watch a video tutorial walking them through using a specific

00:16:26
report in Ahrefs we think that it is a pretty convenient way for people to learn about the tools but knowing that any report you're you you click any button you click you will have a tutorial which is tailored to that report specifically so you can safely click anywhere within the tool and you know that you will get relevant learning materials on how to use this if you're specifically a user of Ahrefs and if you click that how to use button and if it helped you if you want us to expand this to more reports and tools please leave a

00:16:56
comment and let me know so that's it that's the end of the first episode I hope it wasn't too boring I hope my ramblings didn't put you to sleep I hope you've learned something interesting about how we're doing marketing what's happening in Ahrefs and like I said the whole point of this series is to tell you what we're working on how it is working for us like to help you see the progress of our company of what we're doing and how it is working for us so please leave a comment under this video first of course subscribe or
