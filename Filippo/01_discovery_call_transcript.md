  Hey, Filippo, how are you? How's it going?

0:03 - SYNACT
  I'm good. How are you? Going good, man, going good.

0:08 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Awesome.

0:08 - SYNACT
  Yeah. Okay, have you had the time to read the document I sent you?

0:17 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Frankly, no. Okay, no worries.

0:23 - SYNACT
  That's good. Yeah, like, what do you want to talk about? I told you what's the general project is basically a content creator that is helping people to get involved and started with AI and like training them in order to create agents, voice agents, and other type of automation for business. And so he just went like a content farm so that he can spread all the content on multiple accounts so that he can reach more people. video. Bye. Bye. Thank Whenever you have time to read all the documentation, just let me know if it's possible to do, what I need to tell him, and other stuff like the budget, the monthly fee, if there's one, and so on. Actually, yeah.

1:20 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So for this, let me just give you more clarity. I do have a few follow up questions that I want to present. A few sample videos, what type of videos are we looking at? Because every client, every person has a different taste. So once I have probably, let's say two, three, five sample videos, I will be able to tell you that, you know, is it possible through AI? it possible through all these automation pipelines? Because if you're expecting a lot of high quality editing into the videos, it won't be possible. But let's say, you know, there are some, some sort of videos, which are frankly, you know, we know.

2:00 - SYNACT
  Nothing that much difficult, like just an AI avatar talking with the subtitles and maybe some easy b-rolls because I know that like creating a really complex video is still a bit difficult. Even builders are a lot of new tools like Remotion and so on, it's still difficult to get that quality.

2:21 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Yeah, I worked with Remotion as well. So first, the question was how many, what type of videos? The second question was how many videos? What is the iteration?

2:36 - SYNACT
  Okay, he told me 900, but I think that that is too much. Like I think that we can start maybe with a lot less. Like he told me that he wanted five accounts, both on Instagram and TikTok, but I told him that it doesn't make sense because like if you create a content generation automation and it's really good, even if you post just one. And on one account every day, you get the results. So maybe we can start slowly with one account, both on Instagram and TikTok, and then we see how it's going. And then if he wants to scale up, we can still do it. Yeah. Fair enough. Fair enough.

3:16 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So when we say two accounts, still, mean, how many videos per month? I think that maybe once a day.

3:25 - SYNACT
  So it's 30 times two for two accounts. So it's 60 a month. It's good.

3:32 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  60 unique videos when we are creating a single, let's say when we create one video, do we want it to only post on Instagram or do we want to post on all the platforms? same.

3:41 - SYNACT
  No, only Instagram and TikTok for the moment. Right.

3:45 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So when we are targeting Instagram, TikTok, let's say I created one video, one AI avatar video, I can upload the same video on both the platforms or I can create unique videos. So what are we targeting? Mm-hmm. Okay.

3:58 - SYNACT
  Got it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I will ask this to the client because, of course, TikTok, maybe it works better raw content, you know, not that much edited and Instagram on the opposite side, like a bit of editing is good to get traction. So, so, yeah, I will ask him and I will let you know.

4:19 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Fair enough. So, see, the deciding factor in the pricing can be made for $100. as well as $100,000, see, it's a wide range, the only the outcome matters, are we looking at high number of quality? Are we looking at high number of volume? What is the exact thing that we're looking for? And based on that, as soon as I have the clarity, I can get you the pricing because, and there's also one more thing. So I'm not sure if your client is interested in that, when we say monthly retainer, I think that's a much better option because in that way, that just meant it's the breaking. Points, all these things will be handled by us, the people who develop the automation. Of course, I know everything boils down to the pricing part, but for clarity or for, you know, a better understanding, let's ask three questions. What sample videos, how many videos in a month, and do we want the same videos on all the platform or videos should be unique for each platform?

5:27 - SYNACT
  Okay.

5:28 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  I think once I have these three questions, I will be able to draft out the architecture of what should the automation look like, what is going to be the logic. And once I have that, then I think it will be easy for you to pitch to the client as well that, you know, you know, this is the type of automation that we're hoping to build. These are the, all the APIs that we need. This is how much it's going to cost you. This is how much it's going to cost you on a monthly basis as well. And if you are opting for a retainer, this is going to be the retainer for all these different things I can give to you.

5:58 - SYNACT
  Yes. He already told me that he's good on paying for the APIs and all the tools himself, but I don't think this is a problem, but of course I understand that there is a maintenance cost on a monthly retainer. Just tell me, am I right on saying that this kind of automation, you pay a setup fee on the beginning and then a monthly retainer, right? That's good. This is the general setup.

6:26 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  This is the general setup, yes.

6:29 - SYNACT
  Okay.

6:30 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  And at the same time, I think you presented a budget of 628k. you think that this is a budget that is very clarified with the client or is it something that you expect?

6:42 - SYNACT
  This is something that I expected based on what he told me and based on the study that I did on his profile, the number of followers. He also have a school community. So I just base the price on how many people like he's following him and so on. So I... I'm not sure yet, but, you know, I wanted to discuss with you those stuff because, of course, like if you tell me that this kind of automation requires a bigger investment, I don't know, 20K, you tell me, I tell him and then I find a way, you know, to work with him because, of course, I also need to earn something from this. And it's part of the business.

7:21 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  understand that you're working with. So I want to find the best clear that all of us are in the happy situation that, of course, they are also able to get the right results for the right amount of investment. You also get the right amount of, you know, a justified amount of return out of the entire work that you're handling as well and for my team as well. I want to be fair with all of us. That's totally fine.

7:45 - SYNACT
  Of course.

7:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So, yeah, I think these are the three questions that I have. But if you have any other things that you want to provide me, maybe I can.

7:56 - SYNACT
  No, yeah, I just wanted to ask you, like, based on what We just discussed, so no more 900 videos because it doesn't make sense in the beginning. So we said 60 videos a month with the entire automation, so also the self-annealing hoop. So once all the posts are or the videos are posted, then also a final automation that checks the performance so that then from the beginning, if you recreate only the best performance. And so, like, you want me, you want to wait me to ask the client for the budget or do you have an idea so that I can also go to him and tell him effectively what's the real budget? Do you have a... For 900 videos a month, right? Sorry? For 900 videos a month. No, no, for, let's like this, tell me the price for 900 and also tell me the price for 60. So that I can tell him what the options.

9:00 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Let's, let's first, I'll help you understand what is going to be the difference between 60 videos and 900 videos. It's not on any efforts. Since the pipeline will be automated, I don't have to do anything different. But when we're targeting 900 videos, we need at least two or 3000 unique content in a month. We have two to three, I think even 10,000 content that we have, we are able to find in a month. Only then we will be able to filter out that this content is something that I can work with. Then I will start creating the videos. Once I create a video, I will have to review and I will have to make sure that is it fine? Is it not? Let's carry back. Let's try it out again. And the thing is, output really matters into content because of course we can, we can make a pipeline. Then we can, it's, it can start creating videos, but if it doesn't get the right traction, it's of no use, of course, R and D that's what I want to, uh, clarify to the client as well. course, you're looking for at the end results, but it is the product that they want to market. It is their strategy that they're trying to implement. Even they are, they, even they might not be sure of what will work, what will, what will not. So just expect that when we are working together, I think it's going to be more of an R and D thing that we're, let's try out this strategy. Okay. It's not working. Let's try out something else. And the first, I think for the first month, let's try to target that we are able to get high quality content, the right type of content that you want to target. So let's say 10,000 content. And I'm able to filter out 900 out of them. First thing, second thing is when I have any piece of content, I'm able to create the best video that I'm looking for, and this best video, it will take multiple iterations. When we are creating 900 videos in a month, 30 videos in a day, it will take multiple iterations to fix it as well. So I'm guessing almost you will be creating videos 40 to 45 times. So let's To get the right 30 videos, we will be creating 40 videos. Let's say so that we can scrape at least, you know, the bad one, which is almost 10 or 12. I'm just giving an assumption. So when getting 900 videos, these are the complexities that will happen. When we are targeting 60 videos, I only need to get, let's say 800 unique articles out of not 10,000, but only 800, which is easier for me to get. Now, when I have 800 unique articles, I can get, I can filter everything out. I can get 60 unique content pieces and I can create those videos. So it's not about, uh, how much API costs, how will it grow? It's more about the R and D when we are, when you're working with a lot, a big number of content, we need to be more creative. We need to be able to push out really high value content as well.

11:53 - SYNACT
  So that is the type of complexity that I'm talking about.

11:56 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  So, uh, you know, when we say six to eight K. okay. Right. So, I think even after that setup fees, we may need some retainers. And when we create the entire system for this, let's say 900 videos in a month into this range of 600 or 6 to 8K, there may be some things that he will be like, you know, let's improve this, let's improve that, let's improve this prompt and all these things. Okay, yeah.

12:23 - SYNACT
  This is exactly what I told him, that it makes sense to start slowly, see what it works, then slowly we implement other stuff. yeah, I just wanted to tell him maybe on a fixed cost of the monthly retainer, because we can play around with the setup fee, because of course, if we create the first version, it might be cheaper on the beginning, and then we start implementing other things, and so we grew up the price, but the monthly retainer is on average the same, right? Or not? Yeah, so let's say, when you're targeting now,

14:00 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  900 videos that are performing well on the social media side. Okay.

14:05 - SYNACT
  So this option is for the 900, uh, type 900 videos versions. Okay. Okay. And instead for the 60 version, how much do you think is the retainer the month?

14:17 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  When you go for 60, I think it will be, uh, the setup fees will also be reduced. Of course, it will be somewhere in the range of 4, 4.5. I'm guessing it was, it will take almost four people or three people to work on it. And, uh, monthly return for 60 videos. think since quantity is less, it's going to be somewhere, I think 1200 to $1,300 per month. Okay. But yeah, at least that will be the bare minimum. Got it. Got it.

14:49 - SYNACT
  And like, of course, like this guy I, I'm managing, I'm the intermediary in the middle that talk with you and report to him and vice. Yeah, absolutely.

15:02 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  That's good like this.

15:04 - SYNACT
  Yeah. And yeah, I also like when we finish this call, like when you have time, read through the document so that you have all the information, because I think that the best practice for this type of automation is to insert the human in the loop so that it doesn't post things by itself because it doesn't make sense. Like you just create the content and then my client says, okay, go on. Then he create the avatar in the video. He watch it and then he says, okay, go on and so on. You know what I mean?

15:39 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Absolutely. I think I get the point. So what I will do is, of course, the thing is I can make some sort of architecture from this as well. But if you are able to get me the clarity on how the theory questions, what type of video, how many videos and do we want the same videos on multiple platforms? As soon soon as I have clarity. I think the architecture will be more accurate.

16:02 - SYNACT
  Perfect. Okay. That's great, man. So I will ask him this question and I will get back to you. And of course, like, please read the document and get back to me if you have any question. That's good. Absolutely. If I get any other question, I will just ping you there.

16:17 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  Perfect.

16:18 - SYNACT
  Yeah. Okay. That's great. Thanks, man. And see you.

16:24 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)
  See you, Okay. Have a nice night. Bye-bye.
