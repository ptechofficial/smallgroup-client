## What We Do

Small Group builds and runs your content automation pipeline. We handle content discovery, script generation, video production, posting, and performance optimization. Your client focuses on closing deals from the leads that come in.

**Target:** Italian-speaking audience interested in making money online, selling AI agents to local businesses, and no-code business models.

**Funnel goal:** Drive organic traffic to the "Agent Kit" Free Training via Instagram Reels and TikTok.

## Phase 1 Deliverables (Monthly)

| Output | Volume / Month |
|--------|---------------|
| Viral content scraped and analyzed | 800+ pieces |
| Scripts generated (Italian, Agent Kit framework) | 60 |
| AI avatar videos produced (MP4, publish-ready) | 60 |
| Posts scheduled (Instagram + TikTok) | 60 |
| Performance reports | Weekly |

**Daily cadence:** 1 post per day on each platform (Instagram Reels + TikTok).

Every script is generated from proven viral content in the niche, adapted to the Agent Kit 4-step method, and written strictly in Italian. Every video goes through two human approval gates — script approval and video approval — before posting.

## Investment

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Setup fee** | **$5,000** (one-time) |
| **Monthly retainer** | **$1,300 / month** |
| Third-party tools (estimate) | ~$350–500 / month |

**Setup fee** covers the full system build: infrastructure, pipeline configuration, prompt engineering, Airtable workspace, first batch of test content, and all iteration needed to get quality right.

**Monthly retainer** covers ongoing production of 60 videos, performance analysis, prompt optimization, and system maintenance. Retainer starts Month 2 when production is at full volume.

**Tool/API costs are separate and owned by the client.** We'll help set up accounts and select the most cost-effective stack for this volume.

### Tool Cost Breakdown (Estimates)

| Tool | Approximate Cost |
|------|-----------------|
| Apify (web scraping) | ~$49/mo |
| LLM API (OpenAI / Claude) | ~$50–100/mo |
| ElevenLabs (TTS + voice) | ~$100–150/mo |
| Avatar generation (HeyGen or similar) | ~$50–100/mo |
| Video assembly (Creatomate) | ~$50–80/mo |
| Social scheduling (Blotato / Buffer) | ~$30–50/mo |
| Airtable + Google Drive | ~$30/mo |

*Exact costs may vary. We'll advise on optimal plans and configurations.*

- **Week 4:** System goes live. First approved videos posted. Performance tracking active.
- **Month 2 onward:** Full production — 60 videos/month. Weekly optimization based on analytics. Continuous prompt refinement.
