Overview of AI Automation Services @ 0:00

Prakarsh Gupta explained that his company provides customized AI-powered strategies to help businesses optimize their marketing and increase revenue. They analyze a client's target audience, operations, and goals to develop tailored systems for automating content creation, social media engagement, and lead generation.

Automating Content for Stocks App @ 1:01

Ernest Chuang described his company's investing research app that tracks insider stock trades. He is looking to automate the process of generating articles about these trades and distributing them across social media and forums to drive more app downloads. This would involve using AI to extract data from filings, generate article content, and post it through a network of accounts.

Defining the Target Audience @ 4:23

Prakarsh and Ernest discussed that the target audience for the app is male investors, likely in the 22-35 age range, who are interested in stock trading insights and research.

Developing the Content and Engagement Strategy @ 6:37

They outlined a two-pronged approach: 1) Automating the creation of blog posts and social media content about insider stock trades, with the ability to pull data and images directly from filings, and 2) Implementing a system to automatically comment, interact, and drive engagement on relevant social media posts and forums.

Setting Growth Targets @ 24:16

Prakarsh and Ernest agreed to aim for 10-20,000 app downloads over the next 2 months through the organic content and engagement strategy, with the goal of eventually replacing paid marketing entirely with this approach.

Next Steps @ 27:02

Prakarsh proposed having an additional call with his team to review the details provided and develop a more comprehensive strategy. They will also share examples of previous work to demonstrate their capabilities. The plan is to finalize the approach and begin implementation as soon as possible, potentially starting as early as next week.
