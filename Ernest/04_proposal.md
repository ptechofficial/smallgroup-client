# SERVICE PROPOSAL

**Content Automation & App Growth System**

---

**Prepared by:** Small Group
**Prepared for:** Ernest Chuang
**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Proposal valid until:** February 24, 2026

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

This proposal outlines the scope, deliverables, timeline, and investment for a fully managed content automation and app growth system — designed specifically for Ernest Chuang's investing research app.

Small Group will build, deploy, and continuously manage an automated content generation and distribution system that transforms insider stock trade data into SEO-optimized articles, distributes content across multiple social platforms, automates community engagement, and executes app download growth strategies — so Ernest can focus on building his product while organic growth drives downloads.

---

## 2. OBJECTIVES

- Automate the creation of 20-30+ articles per week from insider trade data
- Publish SEO-optimized content targeting stock trading and insider trading keywords
- Distribute content across Reddit, Twitter/X, StockTwits, and investing forums via multi-account networks
- Implement automated engagement (commenting, upvoting, interacting) on relevant financial discussions
- Execute ASO optimization and AppAdvice/Indie App Santa growth campaigns
- Drive 10,000-20,000 app downloads organically within the first 2 months
- Build a long-term organic acquisition channel to replace paid marketing
