Hey, how are you? Good.\n\n1:34 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Hey, Matt, how are you, man?\n\n1:36 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Hey, good, thanks. How's it going? Yeah, pretty good. Had a big day today. I'm a bit tired, but I'm good to go.  Where are you from?\n\n1:48 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  From Australia. From Australia. Australia.\n\n1:54 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Australia, okay, okay, got it.\n\n1:56 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Oh, nice. So, Matt. If you could, you know, before we proceed, if you could explain about yourself, maybe about your business, about your pain points first, then I will proceed with mine.\n\n2:12 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah, sure. So we were six and a half years now, I've been a Facebook ads agency that specializes in helping roofers and home improvement companies.  We have clients in pretty much every state all across America and have done for the whole time we've been in business.  And we, so we do that, we run their ads, we do pretty much everything for them. Most of them are really bad at doing, giving us any content.  So we've always been able to generate and create content and we use, we built out Go High Level. We've been using that for a long time too.  We were one of the first, first users of Go High Level, by the way. So, but yeah. I saw one of the posts you did about how you've been able to automate the meta agency, and I really liked the look of that from the ad creation point, the content creation side of things, like some of the other systems you guys have got too, but that's the one that stuck out to me initially to have a chat about.  Right, right, yeah.\n\n3:24 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  So what things have you tried till now for talking about your most, one of the most main point, which is ad creation, right?  So what things have you tried? For content?\n\n3:38 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Well, we've always been very systematized. So every ad we've ever created, we've stacked and stored and cracked and measured.  And it, and we have a large vault and playbook that we, we use. So we're able to, we were able to.  Get a lot of leverage with a small team servicing, 50 retainer clients is kind of where we cap out.  But with the advancement of AI and stuff like that, I want to be staying with the trends and so creating good quality, like being able to review and scan the performing ads and being able to clone them and recreate them.  And then have the content created really quickly, and scaling in ad accounts, that looked really cool to me.\n\n4:39 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Got it. Okay. So, if you got the solution, do you have any number that how much, you know, this system will help you in talking about the numbers of revenue, like from what perspective are you looking for, for the current clients?  Or maybe for new clients?\n\n5:02 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  A bit of bias, yeah. The benefit it would provide us is it would save us time.\n\n5:13 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Okay, okay, got it. Just, okay. So basically, you know, first I'll tell you about myself that currently what I'm doing, currently I'm running an agency in India, right?  And I'm sure that you have gone through my website. We have worked with the different, different industries in the last couple of years.  And I'm also working with the one digital marketing company based out of us, like that is a simole is present on our website.  It's been more than six to seven months, I guess. So since I guess, yeah. And since I'm working with him, right, so we have to a size for him, right, and help him to scale, of course, like, you know, was stuck on 20 to 25 clients.  Just not able to scale, then we have built a customized software for him. And currently we have helped him increase maybe 10 to 15% of revenue.  Right. So the thing is that he was, he's also running a meta ads actually. He's just managing, uh, he's running it for the painters in the U.S.\n\n6:22 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah.\n\n6:24 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  So for sure, you know, in the next meeting, I'll show the perfect demo of that product. Right. We have also, uh, the Salesforce, uh, GHL and hubs for like different, different CRM of the, in that software.  And we have also integrated the methods preview, right? Like you can see all your methods in that software. And we have also plan.  We also make our, you know, next, GDM plans plan for that client as well. Right. And we are also planning that we'll integrate this software, this solution, like ad creation, and.  I think it was great, yeah.\n\n8:05 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Okay.\n\n8:06 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  So you want all complete solution from creating the content, analyzing and that making the code.\n\n8:14 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Got it. Okay.\n\n8:16 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  So, and how frequently do you want to use the, is there any new frequency of it? How did you want to use it?  It also depends on your business model as well, right? Currently you said that you have 50 plus retainer clients.  So, how exactly do want to use it?\n\n8:37 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Well, yeah, we run, we act as if it was the brand doing it versus like, so we use the client's Facebook page and our account to run most of the ads.\n\n8:56 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Okay.\n\n8:59 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  All right. is that? I'm some marketers just, they use their own ad account, they have their own page, and then they do it that way.  We don't. We act as the brand.\n\n9:13 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So Matthew, sorry to interrupt. I do have a few questions before we start getting into the technical implementation and all these things.  How do you currently operate your business? How do you get your leads? How do you manage them? How do you create the ads?  I just want to understand that. Yeah, sure.\n\n9:32 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  We use Go High Level as our own CRM. In terms of lead gen, we get a lot of, we have a, I create organic content.  I've got a really good system for, but it's all manual. So I post the content every day and I have people reach out.  I then send them my link, my Go High Level link, and they book in that one. Okay. And then when it's not in winter, which will be next month, we run our own ads on Facebook as well.  And just on that, we, so because of winter, because we just kind of have enough by the end of the year, we halve in numbers.  And then as the weather turns, we typically, that's when we go back up to 50.\n\n10:25 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So it's a good time to implement stuff for us at the same So when you say that, when the winter, when the season changes, the numbers, when is, which, which month is it actually?  March is the start of the season.\n\n10:45 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  March and April. Yeah.\n\n10:48 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So we have two to three weeks right now.\n\n10:53 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah, but you know, if it's, it just, that, that's, that's when it does start to ramp up. But if, you know, It's  I'm not putting pressure on timelines or anything, but I've come to you, you know, towards the end, closer to the end of February.  Now, in terms of ad creation, we've sort of alluding to it before, we have every ad we've ever written in our Google Drive.  And we have the industry, we have the date that we wrote it, we know the result, like we've tracked the result, and then we've got, they're all numbered, ad copy, one through, there's hundreds, hundreds and hundreds of proven winners in there.  So we've already got a very large playbook of stuff that's worked well consistently. And then each week I have a team meeting and we tend to come up with stuff in that meeting.  And then, and now we're starting to use AI to help us recreate stuff.\n\n11:59 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  And Who have booked that client, and when the client is booked in, now there's another person who's responsible for creating the creatives, managing the entire meta ad panel and all these different ads.  Do you only do meta ads or Google ads is also one of the things that you handle? Nah, it's just meta at the moment, yeah.\n\n13:19 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Okay.\n\n13:20 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So meta ads we are also trying to do, and so we handle all these things, and of course there's going to be a customer relationship and all.  So, are the people who are working, is it just one guy who's managing the customer communication, or is it divided among the all four of you?\n\n13:40 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Um, my wife does that side of it, and we have one person who does the ads.\n\n13:46 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Who runs the ads for your client or for you as well? Yeah, for both.\n\n13:51 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  For both, okay.\n\n13:53 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So that person handles ads of every account, so 50 people he's managing the ads. I think he must have got.  Do own team on the back end then? No. No, okay. That's awesome.\n\n14:06 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  See, I've come up with some, I don't know how this comes across, but I've come up with some of the leading ads in our space and have done for a long time.  So our stuff is super dialed in now. So our media buyer has a huge playbook of stuff that already works and has worked for a long time.  And then we just build on it bit by bit each week. So it's very systematized in that sense, but very manual.\n\n14:41 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So when we say AI and automation and agents and cloud code agents, cloud bot, all these different tools that are already creating a hype.  How do you see it? You know, if we try to implement AI in a system, will that help you get more clients?  Will that help you make it more systemized? it? stammered\n\n16:00 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  When I see the system that you guys have built, it looks very appealing, and I want to see if it can work for us.  Yeah, yeah.\n\n16:07 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  I'll just quickly give us an intro. So in the past one year, more than one year, we have worked with almost 35 different businesses, right?  We have worked with content creators, we have worked with agency owners, and we have been handling the entire tech end, tech part of them, right?  Parallel, we have been working with them to build out some solid products. When you see meta ads automation, it's not just one chat GPT or custom GPT that is out there.  It's a lot of big automation that have been chained together so that it can automate one entire process, right?  And for every business, in my experience, every business that I've worked with, the only goal is when you're investing, let's say $10,000 to $15,000 into any AI automation, any AI systems into your business, you're looking to get at least 10x of that amount, right?  That's the only reason you would want to invest. Of course, we want to be up in the race, but what does being in the AI?  So every business that I've worked with, entire goal, we can have short term goals like we want an automation that can do competitive analysis.  We want an automation that can post the entire ads for us. We want an automation that can track which ad is doing bad.  What is wrong with it and can upgrade it. There are a lot of systems and I think you already know the playbook, right?  But what is the long term goal? Our long term goal can be that we want to handle more number of clients, or we want to automate your content site.  you're already running content on your Facebook page. Do you want to automate that? Or when we say, you know, there's another person who's handling the customer, your wife is handling the customer communication.  And that is a very big hassle in a lot of businesses. Handling 50 clients on text or on email is a very big hassle.  I know because I've been working with a lot of businesses myself. Tushar has been doing the same as well.  So the reason I'm asking you this is all So The systems that I have built over the past one year, the smart ads automation that you saw, and all these things, it only depends on what exactly do you want out of it?\n\n18:11 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Right?\n\n18:11 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  If you want to automate our business end of it, that is, if any, any client, let's say I have Matthew as my client who's, who wants 10 different ads running on their business every single month.  And I want to manage that. If that is my problem statement, then I will build this entire system that as soon as the client is there, we want to understand the business.  We want to understand the entire tonality, your, their ICP, all these different details and have an entire book of knowledge that what does business do?  Then we want another system that can use this knowledge, can create right creatives for them that you already have.  You have an experience. You have been doing this business for 6.5 years. You know, what ads work, what I do not work.  So you want, we want to use that knowledge as well. And we want. to have the customer information to create these ad creatives and post it automatically, right?  It's not just photos. There is all the short form videos. There is textual content. There is repost comment engagement or a lot of different things are out in the market.  So when we say we want to automate our agency, we want to automate our ads agency. We still need a few people who's just taking a look at it.  First, we want people who can build the system. Then we want people who can understand the system and keep correcting it over a period of time.  You have been doing this business for six years. You know, every single week, every single month, you have learned something new and you have corrected yourself.  That's why you are able to manage 50 people in your current four people team. So what I want to understand is when we say, Hey, Tushar, Hey, Prakash, we want to automate our agency.  What exactly do we want to do we want to lead generation automation? That is, that is also that we have built.  Do we want to automate how we are creating ads for a business? Again, the system that I told you about, we have that built, but as soon as I understand your problem statement, my focus is going to be going into the nitty gritties of how you work and create the system that is optimal for you, not for anyone else.  If it is optimal for you, then it is going to be very easy for you to use it. But if I may, if I create a generalized product that you, that I can create a SaaS product for you, and then you can simply say that the Prakash just gave it to me and you may not use it.  It may not give you that results. So again, just coming back to the question now, what do you see that?  What problem is the first problem that you want to implement in your business using AI?\n\n20:47 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  We dropped out a bit at the end there. What was the, could you repeat the question?\n\n20:52 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Yeah, all I'm saying is now that you, we understand what this AI system and all these things have been been doing for different people.  So when that is the problem statement, I would want to understand what do you do in your business? How are you contributing?  And then I will try to suggest you, how can we get you only contribute very less amount of time so that you just only to have to take the overview.  Yeah, can you answer that?\n\n22:36 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  What was it? What do I do? And what are the things that take up the most time? Correct. Yeah, okay.  Creating the content and posting and doing all that manually. Well, that's time consuming and I haven't done it well for a while, but how My  Because I've created so much from the past, I've got a big, big vault that I can draw on, but it's definitely time consuming.  It's one of the most important things in the business. Ad strategy would be the thing that takes the most brain power.  And then that, and something that I, and a problem that I've never been able to solve is, is content creation for the clients.  Hmm.\n\n23:36 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Okay. So when we said content creation on your end, I would, so there are three questions that three things that you mentioned, content creation for you, content creation for your clients.  And the third one was, uh, creating the strategy for each and every client, right?\n\n23:52 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  And report and reporting for client reporting. We, we don't have much in place. Yeah. Yeah. All right.\n\n24:00 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  I think that's a very good thing that we can start with. So when we say content creation for you, how are you currently creating content?  See, I'm a very curious guy. I just like to keep asking a lot of questions. So that I think everything about you, and then I'm gonna drop you an amazing agent that can do everything for you.\n\n24:22 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  So the way, my system and model for content creation, I have, I do a variety of different things that all relate into four or five different categories.  The first one is sharing stuff about me in my personal life and my family, showing us having fun, going on adventures, like so I'm very relatable.  I do a little bit on motivation and inspiration. I have a pretty cool story, like a pretty cool comeback story.  and I share stuff about that. .\n\n26:00 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Creating, or see, I think testimonial is something that can be easily taken care of. Yeah. Post this testimonial organization, we get on different platforms, on different.  When we say putting videos for you, uh, what do you want someone to handle these things? For example, as soon as you are, sorry.  So are you recording your own videos or is it something like, uh, you have some pipeline that you use and that I can also use to create an automated content for you?  Hmm.\n\n26:35 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  One thing I didn't clarify. So with the content, it is a mix too, of some, some are videos and some, uh, uh, short written things.  Some are memes, some, uh, long form written content with, with images. Um, so it is a variety of all.  Um, and then in terms of the video we've had, uh, Um, um, We've had video content creation. What's, I can't even remember, I'm a bit tired, that particular role.  We've had people come on and create reels and chop things up and turn it into videos for us. We've had a podcast that was reasonably successful where reels were created out of that.  I hired a video content agency and we used to do short form videos. So I've got a big vault of stuff like that.  And then every now and again, I'll just record stuff straight from my phone and post it.\n\n27:36 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  I think this is a good clarity. And what I would ask you to do is probably Tushar if you can create a group for us and where Matthew can just drop in the social media.  I can just go through and analyze what he's trying to do so that I can come up with the, in the next call, I can come up with the right strategy for M13.  think this is... That's the agent that we're going to build, and this is how it's going to build life, right?  That is going to solve the first part. The second part is strategies for your clients, right? Now, can you deep dive into how you build strategies for your clients?  What is your playbook?\n\n28:20 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  So the system that I use and the strategy for the clients, it has some similarity to what I just shared with you, but it's more direct around their business.  But we utilize a lot of personal images, sharing images and stuff or videos of them and their family, but we tie that into an ad.  So the ads that we use, we have ads that are more personal, that are, they're not a direct response ads.  It just shows who they are, what they do, why people should reach out to them. We have ads that are.  Very direct. have a really hot offer in them. We have ads that tell great stories about pain points and frustrations.  We have testimonials and that I turn that into the system, the ad system for the clients. That is pretty similar to what I do, but far more branded to their, to their business.  Like I can share one of hilarious, crazy stuff and can get away with it because our brand is about having fun and drinking from the skulls of your enemies and all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff.  Whereas I can't really do that, but there is some similarity and we make it very relatable type ads. We have ads that have great offers in them.  We have ads that are testimonial and result based, and we have ads that tell great stories or share content.  good case studies and stuff like that. Got it.\n\n29:57 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  And do you have any documented method of Of how you are building this strategy or whatever you share with the clients and what you want from the clients and all these things.\n\n30:13 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  We just ask, we just show them the images and videos that we need from them. We just have a video that we send them.  And so this is the stuff that's working. Get us that and we'll take care of the rest. And then we also use a bit of Arcad's AI to do some like talking head videos because most of our, like they're all tradies or roofers, home improvement guys.  They don't really like recording videos. Fun fact. we can get content from their Facebook page and stuff like that.  Yeah. Just a fun fact.\n\n30:51 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Actually, when you mentioned Arcad's. So Arcad's have, uh, they have sponsored a few of my YouTube videos, I create YouTube content and I YouTube, I.  Create YouTube content related to AI automation and how people businesses can, you know, use different app systems and all these things.  So our guides reached out to me, uh, Roman, Roman is the co-founder of it. I am a decent friend of him and, uh, we had a good chart there.  And then, then I got to know about his platform and how the quality of videos that he's creating, that is compared to a agent.  think that's phenomenal. The reality is very much there. Of course, when you use 11 labs voice and all these things, it just creates your existence.  So I've created automations that can create these head talking videos for different automations. So I think that we can leverage.  So I think I'm able to get some picture that, you know, I can use these and these pieces to stitch together the system for you.  And, uh, yeah, in this, this part, I would want a few more things just to get clarity on the second part, the video that you sent that, you know, you want XYZ type of video and you want XYZ.  What of testimonials and images so that you can start creating the content for them. I would want that if you can send me that video, what all things are you asking for them and example, any example business that have shared you these things.  I just want to see the output that you have been bringing so that I am easily able to replicate that.  If that makes sense. Sure. I'll just write that down.\n\n32:26 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah. Tushar. Yeah.\n\n32:28 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  As soon as Tushar can create a group, I can quickly send you what all things I need, I need from you.  And then you send me all these things. Now, the third question that you have, that was creating content, automating the content strategies, content pipeline for your clients as well.  So right now, I think you've answered, you've already given me great insight on how you're creating the strategy. When you talk about creating the content, who is creating the content for your clients right now?\n\n32:59 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  All Yeah, we pretty much do. I say pretty much like the way that we've been able to do it and still get good results is we go to their Facebook, their personal Facebook page, and we can normally get enough personal images of them or them and their wife and their kids and stuff to make it work for a while.  We then ask them to give us stuff just like that. On their business Facebook page, they've normally got some drone footage or they've had some people make some videos in the past.  And so we've normally got a good starting point. And then we just show them this stuff is what's working.  And then we will then create some talking head videos or we'll create some still images with banners. We've got a whole, everything we've ever done that's worked, we have tracked and measured in a content library as well.  So we've got a lot of pre-made stuff that we continue to use. next And Got it.\n\n34:03 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  I think, yeah, if you have all these things, this is quite beneficial. And, uh, so who is the person?  Is it the Philippines guy who's creating the textual copy and all the copy? Or is it someone else who's all the contract?\n\n34:21 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah. Yeah. She, she, she essentially implements the strategy. Okay. From Philippines. Is that her? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. Great.\n\n34:33 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  And, uh, let's say I'm a client of yours, right? Uh, what are the offers that you allow me so that I can purchase your services?  To sign up with us?\n\n34:46 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah.\n\n34:47 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  What is the package?\n\n34:49 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  You might like this. There's no real offer. Yeah. Sorry. Because it's so heavily based on people come to us because of the results  We've been able to generate, but we'll put a minimum in there to make sure that they're comfortable and confident.  We have like a 3K retainer, and if we don't get them a certain number of leads, we won't charge them the next month until we do.  That's as big as the offer go. We've never had to because we've got really good positioning. Yeah.\n\n35:30 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  I think that's, I understand the entire point of it, because that is something that we're also trying, we are also doing, even though we did not have to do it anytime.  Thing is when we work with lead generation automation and all these things, even we say that we're going to get you X number of leads by the end of two months.  And if you're not able to do it, we are not going to charge 20% of the entire amount. And the reason is because we are so confident about the strategies, because we have understood the business once, in and out.  Once we have understood it, now we. We know that what works in the lead generation business, what does not.  And that's why you're able to put it. although even we haven't been able to, uh, you know, uh, not take that 20% because we are able to generate the results.  So that is a good part to begin with. Now, again, I think I'm just going to go back to a few hypothetical questions.  When we say that, let's say you gave me these three problems. If I am able to save you enough, this, this amount of effort, I'm able to automate these things, you get enough time, right?  What does that mean to you in the business terms? You know, are you going to be looking into expanding the business?  Are you going to be focusing on the family or do you want, you know, uh, what result that does that bring you by saving your time?\n\n36:46 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Um, yeah, I would most likely reinvest the time into business, uh, strategy, growth. We also have a property business.  It's turned into a business.\n\n38:00 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  No, not really.\n\n38:04 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Okay.\n\n38:06 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Okay, Tushar, do you have anything?\n\n38:10 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Nothing, nothing, nothing from Smith. Perfect.\n\n38:14 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  What is your business called, by the way? Mattsmithconsulting.\n\n38:18 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Pretty straightforward. Yeah. Okay.\n\n38:36 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Alright, so Tushar, do you have Matthew's WhatsApp number so that we can create the group?\n\n38:42 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  No, like, we can actually.\n\n38:44 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Yeah, Matthew, if you can just drop your WhatsApp number here, and then we can bring this conversation on text.  I can share you all the details, what I want. And, yeah.\n\n38:58 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n39:04 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  And what do you think that if I say, you know, let's have, I want to have a call with you so that I can create the right strategy for your system, what is the best time as well as a date that should work?\n\n39:23 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  We, I can do this time with you guys. So we kind of, we kind of do, we're kind of on the opposite ends of time zones with, you're doing like the start of the American day going into the mid morning, whereas I do the early afternoon through to the evening, but I can do these times because everyone's in bed.\n\n39:47 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So is it Thursday for you or is it Friday?\n\n39:51 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  It is Thursday, 9, 10 PM. Okay, Thursday, 10 PM. I normally do like 5 AM Australian through to...\n\n40:06 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So how about we can connect probably in two days. We can connect on Saturday, same time. What do you think, Tushar?  Are you available?\n\n40:19 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, perfect. So let's connect at the same time, Saturday.\n\n40:23 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  And I tell them, let me prepare up the right strategies for you. And then I can give you the right system.  What all exactly do you need in a business to get ahead? I don't want you to just be similar to other agencies who are doing AI.  I wanted to get ahead of it. plan out that. And then I can show you all the system that we have already built so that you have an idea what we have on the plate as well.  Right? Yeah.\n\n40:49 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah, I have a big interest in a good handful of what I saw on the website, but I thought we'd go the way we had tonight.  out, which is focus on a few things. And then go from there, yeah. What other thing are you interested in?  Well, I loved the LinkedIn automation, posting content, lead generation, and the same. I see that in cold email or coldish warm email, lead gen system as the same sort of thing.  I loved that. That looked great. I loved the Instagram system. That looked pretty cool too. There was the meta one.  We talked about content creation. What else? You guys have some really cool stuff actually. I can't remember. Yeah, let me have a look.  screen. Let me have a Yeah. Okay, so up Yeah.\n\n41:57 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.\n\n42:01 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Oh, the recruitment, I liked the look of that, HR agent, yeah, that was badass, and the SEO blog writer, so I get asked, we get asked all the time to implement more stuff for our clients, and we have a good, because what we do is very seasonal, like I sort of explained at the start, our business drops in half, and by the end of the year, we're really happy about that, because we can rest and recuperate and stuff like that, but point being, I have a good number, a broad number of former clients who have mostly been very happy with us, there's always a few that aren't, and I get hit up all the time for different things and different projects and stuff like that, and I say no to a lot, because I can't deliver on it, I just wouldn't, but that's a long-winded.  Good way of saying I'm getting asked for clients to do, like, how to get them found through the LLMs, how to get found on ChatGPT, to be recommended on ChatGPT and stuff like that.  So I see the AI system that you've built there as being some good crossover for that. Yeah.\n\n43:25 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  It is actually the exact thing that you're looking for, I know. And, uh, I think that, uh, since you're interested in all these things, I would love to have a longer call with you that I can show you each one of the systems, because if you're liking it, just by looking at the post, I know you're going to love it as soon as I drop in the entire system and how it works.  So I'm excited for that. But if you can list down the right things that you look interested in, let's say, if you are interested in this, your blog writer or the HR agent part.  And I can probably prepare everything up for you in the next one. So. So let me know what other, what other systems that are you interested in immediately because, yeah, while developing these things, you know, as I mentioned, you know, I've worked with different businesses.  So every business has a different type of problem. Every business has a different type of way of working. So my role is just to understand what you want, how you do it.  And then me and Tushar and the entire team, we have a team of almost 25 people here. And we, we have to crack down the right systems for them.  And how, what is the NDS part? So that is something that I will have to do on the back end.\n\n44:41 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Yeah, cool. Love that. Awesome, Arani. Yeah, we can do that for sure. Perfect.\n\n44:47 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  So let's connect on Saturday, same time, and then I'll have a better pitch way. All right. Right. All right.\n\n44:55 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Okay. Thank you, Tushar. Thank you, Matthew.\n\n44:56 - Prakarsh Gupta\n  Have a very nice day.\n\n44:58 - Matthew Smith (matsmithconsulting.com)\n  Thanks, guys. guys.\n\n45:00 - Tushar Mangla (tushar.mangla1120@gmail.com)\n  Thank you.","size":"33.3 KB","path":"Matsmith/01_discovery_call_transcript.md"},{"filename":"02_pre_call_questions.md","title":"Pre Call Questions","content":"# Pre-Call Questions for Matthew Smith\n\n> **Context:** These questions fill gaps from the Feb 19 discovery call.

Very systematized but manual. |\n| **Pain Points** | 1) Own content creation is manual & time-consuming. 2) Client content creation — \"a problem I've never been able to solve.\" 3) Ad strategy eats most brain power. 4) Client reporting — \"don't have much in place.\" |\n| **Interests** | Meta ads automation, content engine, LinkedIn automation, cold email, Instagram system, HR/recruitment agent, SEO blog writer, LLM visibility (getting found on ChatGPT) |\n| **How Found Us** | Saw a post about automating a meta agency |\n| **Season** | Peak season starts March/April — we're in the ramp-up window now |\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask Matthew\n\n### A. Numbers & Revenue (Critical for ROI framing)\n\n1. **What's your total monthly revenue at peak (50 clients)?** We know each client is ~$3K/month, so roughly $150K/month — can you confirm?\n\n2. **What's your average client lifetime?** How many months does a typical roofer stay with you? (Needed to calculate LTV and frame our cost against it.)\n\n3. **What's your current monthly ad spend on your own lead gen?** When you're running your own Facebook ads outside of winter, what's the typical budget?\n\n4. **What's your current cost structure?** Rough monthly cost for your team — media buyer, Philippines VA, any contractors? (Helps us frame automation savings.)\n\n5. **How many new clients do you typically onboard per month during peak season?** And what's your close rate from discovery call to signed retainer?\n\n---\n\n### B. Scope & Priority (Critical for proposal)\n\n6. **Rank your top 3 priorities from this list:**\n   - [ ] Automating your own content creation & posting\n   - [ ] Automating ad creative generation for clients\n   - [ ] Client reporting dashboard/automation\n   - [ ] LinkedIn outreach / lead gen for your agency\n   - [ ] Cold email / warm email lead gen\n   - [ ] SEO blog writing for clients\n   - [ ] HR/recruitment agent\n   - [ ] LLM visibility (getting clients found on ChatGPT)\n\n7. **For ad creative automation specifically — how many new ad variations do you create per client per month?** (e.g., 4 new creatives/month? 10? Just refreshes of existing winners?)\n\n8. **For your own content — what's the target posting frequency?** Daily across which platforms? (Facebook only? LinkedIn too? Instagram?)\n\n9. **For client reporting — what do your clients currently receive?** Monthly report? Weekly? Nothing? What metrics do they care about most?\n\n---\n\n### C. Budget & Investment (Critical for pricing)\n\n10. **Do you have a budget range in mind for AI/automation systems?** (Not a commitment — just helps us right-size the proposal. One-time build vs. ongoing managed service.)\n\n11. **Would you prefer to start with one system and expand, or implement multiple systems at once?** (Phase 1 vs. full rollout.)\n\n12. **Are you the sole decision-maker, or does your wife / business partner need to sign off?** Should she be on the next call?\n\n---\n\n### D. Technical & Access (Critical for system design)\n\n13. **Can you share access to your Google Drive ad vault?** (Or a sample — we need to understand the structure to build an AI that can scan, categorize, and clone winning ads.)\n\n14. **Can you share the onboarding video you send to new clients?** (The one where you show them what content/images/videos you need from them.)\n\n15. **Can you share 2-3 example client ad accounts or campaigns?** (Doesn't need to be live access — screenshots of the ad manager showing your campaign structure, naming conventions, and performance metrics work.)\n\n16. **What does your Go High Level setup look like?** Pipelines, automations, sequences — are you using it beyond CRM + booking? (Determines integration complexity.)\n\n17. **Do you use Meta Business Manager with shared access, or individual ad accounts per client?** (Affects how we build the automation.)\n\n---\n\n### E. Content Assets (Promised from Call 1)\n\n18. **Your social media profiles** — Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram links so we can analyze your current content style and frequency.\n\n19. **Your content categories/pillars breakdown** — You mentioned 4-5 categories (personal/family, motivation, testimonials, etc.). Can you list all of them with a rough % split?\n\n20. **Sample winning ads** — 5-10 of your best-performing ads from the vault (copy + creative) so we can train the AI on your proven style.\n\n---\n\n### F. Growth Vision (For Phase 2 seeding)\n\n21. **If time and capacity weren't a constraint, how many clients would you want to manage?** 75? 100? Or is 50 the sweet spot and you'd rather increase revenue per client?\n\n22. **You mentioned clients asking you for SEO, LLM visibility, and other services. How many of these requests do you get per month?** (Helps us size the upsell opportunity.)\n\n23. **You mentioned a property business — is that something you'd eventually want automation for too, or is it separate?**\n\n---\n\n## Items Promised During Call 1\n\nThese were explicitly agreed to be shared in the WhatsApp group:\n\n- [ ] Matthew's WhatsApp number (for group creation)\n- [ ] The onboarding video he sends to clients requesting content\n- [ ] Example client deliverables (ads, creatives)\n- [ ] His social media profiles for analysis\n- [ ] List of which systems he's most interested in (from the website)\n","size":"6.5 KB","path":"Matsmith/02_pre_call_questions.md"},{"filename":"03_sales_script.md","title":"Sales Script","content":"# SALES CALL SCRIPT — Matthew Smith (Follow-Up Call)\n\n**Date:** February 21, 2026\n**Call Type:** Follow-up strategy presentation\n**First Call:** February 2026\n**Goal:** Present the 3-pillar Ad Creative Automation System, walk through pricing, close or schedule next step\n\n---\n\n## PRE-CALL CHECKLIST\n\n- [ ] Pitch deck open and ready to screen share (03_pitch_deck.html)\n- [ ] Proposal document ready to send\n- [ ] First call transcript reviewed (key details fresh in mind)\n- [ ] Know Matthew's name, agency details, team structure, and what he asked for\n- [ ] Quiet environment, camera on, good audio\n- [ ] CRM/notes open to capture anything new Matthew shares\n\n---\n\n## OPENING (2-3 minutes)\n\n**Build rapport, set the agenda, plant the frame.**\n\n> \"Hey Matthew, good to see you again.

You've got about 50 clients on retainer at $3K a month each, with a lean team of four people — you on strategy and content, your wife handling client comms, one media buyer running all 50 accounts solo, and a VA in the Philippines implementing ad strategy.\"\n\n> \"You told me your system is — and I'm using your exact words — 'very systematized but very manual.' You've got hundreds and hundreds of proven winners in your Google Drive vault, tracked by industry, date, and result. You said you're running some of the leading ads in your space. The machine works. But the manual parts are killing your capacity.\"\n\n> \"The big one you flagged was client content creation. You called it 'a problem I've never been able to solve.' Right now you're pulling from client Facebook pages, requesting video content, creating banners and stills, using Arcads for talking heads — but it's all manual. Your VA implements, but the creative bottleneck is real.\"\n\n> \"On top of that, your own personal content — the daily organic stuff that drives your inbound leads — you're creating and posting all of that manually. And on the reporting side, you said you 'don't have much in place' for client reporting.\"\n\n> \"The goal is to save time on the stuff that's working, automate the repetitive creative work, and free up your brain power for ad strategy — which is where you actually move the needle.\"\n\n> \"Did I miss anything? Anything you'd add or change?\"\n\n**Let him respond. Take notes on anything new. Then transition:**\n\n> \"Perfect. So based on all of that, here's what we put together...\"\n\n---\n\n## THE STRATEGY PRESENTATION (10-15 minutes)\n\n### Pillar 1: AI Ad Creative Engine\n\n**This is the big one. His #1 pain point. Lead with his words.**\n\n> \"Let's start with the thing you told me has been 'a problem I've never been able to solve' — creating ad content for clients at scale.\"\n\n> \"Right now, the process works but it's all manual. You pull from client pages, request content, create variations, your VA implements. And you've got this incredible asset sitting in Google Drive — hundreds and hundreds of proven winners tracked by industry, date, and result. You said you're 'super dialed in now' with some of the leading ads in your space. That vault is gold.\"\n\n> \"Here's what we build. An AI creative engine that plugs directly into your ad vault. The system scans your proven winners — the copy, the hooks, the structures, the angles — and learns what works. Then it generates new variations at scale. Fresh ad copy that follows the same patterns that already win for you, but with new angles, new hooks, new takes.\"\n\n> \"We're talking about your four categories — personal and relatable, direct response with a hot offer, pain point stories, and testimonial-based ads — all being generated automatically based on the patterns in your vault. The AI doesn't guess. It clones what's already working and creates variations you can test.\"\n\n> \"And for the visual side — banners, stills, creative assets — the system pulls from client content, generates variations, and formats them ready for your VA to implement. Instead of your team spending hours building each creative from scratch, you're reviewing and approving AI-generated options.\"\n\n> \"Think about it — you said creating content is one of the most important things in the business, but it's also the biggest bottleneck. What if your team could generate in 30 minutes what currently takes a full day? And the quality stays high because it's all trained on your proven winners — not generic templates.\"\n\n> \"You told me you want 'the stuff that's working — get us that and we'll take care of the rest.' That's exactly what this does.\"\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 2: Personal Content Automation\n\n**This is where we drop the proof.**\n\n> \"Pillar two is your own content — the daily organic stuff that drives your inbound leads.\"\n\n> \"Right now, you're 'creating the content and posting and doing all that manually.' You've got a great mix — personal and family content, your comeback story, testimonials, memes, short and long form, video reels. It works. It drives inbound. But it eats your time every single day.\"\n\n> \"What we build is a content automation system for your personal brand. We analyze your existing content — what's performed well, what gets engagement, what drives bookings — and the system generates a content calendar with ready-to-post content. Captions, hooks, hashtags, posting schedule. You review, approve, and it goes out automatically.\"\n\n> \"You said you want to be 'staying with the trends.' The system monitors what's working in your space — what other agency owners are posting, what's getting traction in the roofing and home improvement niche — and incorporates those trends into your content pipeline.\"\n\n> \"Now here's why I'm confident this works. This isn't a proposal I'm reading off a page. We already built this exact type of system for another Meta ads agency. They run Facebook ads for painters in the US — similar model to yours, 20 to 25 clients. We built them an ad creative automation system and it helped them scale their output and increase revenue 10 to 15 percent. The engine already exists. For your business, we customize it to your vault, your categories, your clients' industries. But the system? It's built. It's running.\"\n\n**Pause. Let that land.**\n\n> \"So instead of spending an hour or two every day on your own content, you're spending 15 minutes reviewing what the system generated. That time goes back to ad strategy — which is where your brain power actually makes money.\"\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 3: Client Reporting System\n\n> \"The third piece is something you said you 'don't have much in place' for — client reporting.\"\n\n> \"Right now, with 50 clients on retainer, your wife is handling client comms, but there's no automated reporting. That means either clients are asking for updates and your team is scrambling, or they're not getting visibility into results at all.\"\n\n> \"What we build is an automated reporting system that pulls data from your Meta ad accounts and generates weekly client reports. Performance metrics, spend, results, trends — formatted and sent automatically. Every client, every week, no manual work.\"\n\n> \"This does two things. First, it saves your wife hours every week on client communication — they're getting proactive updates instead of asking questions. Second, and this is the bigger play — clients who see their results regularly stay longer. They renew because they can see the value. That's especially important during your winter dip when you're trying to retain as many of those 50 accounts as possible.\"\n\n> \"You're running 50 accounts. Even at 15 minutes per report manually, that's over 12 hours a week just on reporting. The system does it in seconds.\"\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 2 TEASE (3 minutes)\n\n**Don't sell this. Just plant the seed.**\n\n> \"Now, everything I just walked you through is Phase 1 — the ad creative engine, your personal content, and client reporting. That's what we build and launch in the first four weeks.\"\n\n> \"But I want to give you a quick look at where this can go. You mentioned a few things on our first call — LinkedIn automation for a different lead channel, cold email outreach, potentially building out Instagram, even an HR recruitment agent for finding talent. There's also SEO and blog content that could drive organic leads to your agency long-term.\"\n\n> \"We're not scoping or pricing any of that right now. I just want you to see that the infrastructure we're building in Phase 1 — the AI training, the automations, the integrations — that becomes the foundation for everything else. Once the core system is running, expanding into those areas is straightforward. But first things first — let's get the creative engine and reporting live.\"\n\n---\n\n## PRICING PRESENTATION (5 minutes)\n\n**Timeline first. Then value stack. Then price.**\n\n> \"So that's the full system — three pillars working together. AI ad creative generation trained on your vault, personal content automation, and automated client reporting for all 50 accounts. Let me talk about what it takes to get this running.\"\n\n### Timeline\n\n> \"We can have this fully live in four weeks. Here's the breakdown:\"\n\n> \"Week 1 — Infrastructure. We ingest your entire ad vault into the AI system, train the models on your proven winners, and set up all the integrations with Go High Level and your Meta accounts.\"\n\n> \"Week 2 — Build. We construct the creative pipeline, set up your personal content calendar, and build out the reporting templates for your clients.\"\n\n> \"Week 3 — Go Live. First AI-generated creatives come out for your team to review, your personal content starts posting, and we run test reports across a handful of accounts.\"\n\n> \"Week 4 — Full Volume. All clients are active in the reporting system, ad creatives are flowing at scale, and your personal content is running on autopilot.\"\n\n> \"That means if we start now, you're fully operational before peak season hits in March and April. You ramp into your busiest months with the system already running — not scrambling to build it while you're onboarding new clients.\"\n\n### Value Stack\n\n> \"Here's everything you're getting: the AI ad creative engine trained on your hundreds of proven winners. Automated creative generation across all four of your ad categories. Personal content automation for your daily organic posts. Automated weekly reports for all 50 client accounts. Full integration with Go High Level and your Meta ad accounts. And ongoing optimization as we learn what the AI generates best.\"\n\n### Tool Costs\n\n> \"Before I get to our fee, let me cover tool costs. There are third-party tools the system runs on — AI APIs, scheduling tools, reporting infrastructure. That runs about $160 a month. These are in your name, you own the accounts, and you'd have these regardless of whether you work with us or not.\"\n\n### Two Options\n\n> \"There are two ways to work with us.\"\n\n### Option 1 — One-Time Build\n\n> \"Option one is a one-time build. We design and build the entire system — the creative engine, the content automation, the reporting infrastructure — train it on your vault, and hand it off to you. Your team runs it. That's $7,500 one-time, and it includes two weeks of support after handoff.\"\n\n> \"The tradeoff is your team would need to manage and optimize the system ongoing. If the AI needs retraining, if new ad categories emerge, if something breaks — that's on your side. And you'd probably need your VA spending 5 to 10 hours a week managing the outputs.\"\n\n### Option 2 — Fully Managed (Recommend this)\n\n> \"Option two — and this is what I'd recommend — is fully managed. We build everything AND we run it for you. Every week, my team is monitoring the creative output, optimizing the AI based on which ads are performing, managing your content calendar, ensuring reports go out, and adjusting the system as your client roster changes.\"\n\n> \"That's $2,500 a month, 6-month commitment. Month 1 is split — $1,250 upfront and $1,250 at the end of the month. Plus the $160 a month in tool costs.\"\n\n### The ROI Frame\n\n> \"Let me put this in context. Each of your clients pays $3,000 a month. If the content automation helps you retain even one additional client through the winter — one client who would have churned because they weren't seeing reports or felt like things were stale — that one client covers the entire monthly cost and then some.\"\n\n> \"Or look at it from the inbound side. Your personal content drives leads. If automating your content frees up your time and keeps you posting consistently — and that consistency brings in even one new client — that's $3,000 a month in new revenue against a $2,500 investment.\"\n\n> \"Compare it to hiring. If you hired someone to do what this system does — creative generation, content management, reporting for 50 accounts — you're looking at $4,000 a month minimum. Probably more. And they still need training, management, and months to ramp up. The system is live in four weeks.\"\n\n> \"At $2,500 a month, this is less than one client's retainer. And it touches every client you have.\"\n\n**SILENCE after stating the ROI. Do not fill the gap. Let him process.**\n\n---\n\n## HANDLING OBJECTIONS\n\n### \"That's expensive\"\n\n> \"I hear you. Let me frame it this way — you've got 50 clients at $3K each. That's $150K a month in revenue. We're talking about $2,500 a month to automate the creative bottleneck you've been trying to solve for six and a half years. That's less than 2% of your revenue.\"\n\n> \"And compare it to the alternative. If you hired a dedicated creative person to handle ad variations and client reporting for 50 accounts, you're looking at $4,000 a month minimum — and they'd take months to learn your system. We already built this for another Meta ads agency. The system exists. We're customizing it for you.\"\n\n> \"You told me this was 'a problem I've never been able to solve.' At less than the cost of one client's retainer, this is the solve.\"\n\n### \"Want to start small\"\n\n> \"That's exactly what Option 1 is for. $7,500 one-time, we build the whole system, hand it off, and your team runs it. It's a lower monthly commitment. The tradeoff is you're investing your VA's time to manage it, and you don't get our ongoing optimization. But it's a real option if you want to test the waters before committing to managed.\"\n\n### \"Can I just do this myself with AI tools?\"\n\n> \"You absolutely could. The question is time. You'd need to figure out how to ingest your vault, train the models, build the content pipeline, set up the reporting integrations, test everything, and iterate until the output quality matches your standard. That's 2 to 3 months of figuring it out — and that's time you should be spending on ad strategy, which is where you actually make money.\"\n\n> \"We already built this exact system. We plug you in now. You're live in four weeks instead of four months.\"\n\n### \"Need to discuss with my wife\"\n\n> \"Absolutely — and honestly, she should love this. Think about what it does for her specifically. Right now she's handling client comms for 50 accounts with no automated reporting. This system sends every client a professional weekly report automatically. That alone probably saves her 10 to 12 hours a week. Instead of fielding 'how are my ads doing?' calls, clients are getting proactive updates. It makes her job significantly easier.\"\n\n> \"Happy to jump on a quick call with both of you if that would help.\"\n\n### \"Can you guarantee results?\"\n\n> \"I can guarantee the system, the effort, and the ongoing optimization. What I can't guarantee is specific numbers — and anyone who does is lying to you. What I can tell you is we already built this for another Meta ads agency running Facebook ads for painters. It worked. It increased their output and helped them grow revenue 10 to 15 percent. Your vault of proven winners gives us an even stronger starting point than they had.\"\n\n### \"I need to think about it\"\n\n> \"Totally fair. Here's what I'd keep in mind though — your peak season starts in March and April. The system takes four weeks to build. If we start now, you're live right when things ramp up. If we wait, you're heading into your busiest months with the same manual process and the same bottleneck.\"\n\n> \"What specifically do you want to think through? Is it the investment, the approach, or which option? I'd rather answer the real question now than have it linger.\"\n\n---\n\n## CLOSING (3-5 minutes)\n\n> \"So to recap — we're building you a three-part system. Your ad vault of hundreds of proven winners gets turned into an AI-powered creative engine that generates new ad variations at scale. Your personal content goes from fully manual to automated with a 15-minute daily review. And every one of your 50 clients gets automated weekly performance reports — something you said you don't have in place today.\"\n\n> \"The system is live in four weeks — just in time for peak season. And it directly solves the thing you told me has been 'a problem I've never been able to solve' for six and a half years.\"\n\n**Plant the Yes/No frame:**\n\n> \"At the end of the day, there's really only two outcomes here — either this makes sense for where you're at or it doesn't. The one thing I want to avoid is 'let me think about it' — because that usually means there's a question I didn't answer. So if there's anything on your mind, let's get into it now.\"\n\n**Ask for the close:**\n\n> \"Which option makes more sense for where you're at right now — the one-time build or the fully managed?\"\n\n**If he says fully managed:**\n\n> \"Great. I'll send the agreement over today. Once you sign, we start Week 1 this week — vault ingestion, AI training, integrations. Four weeks from now, you're live. That puts you right on time for the March ramp-up.\"\n\n**If he says one-time build:**\n\n> \"Makes sense. I'll get the agreement to you today. Same four-week timeline — we build everything out, do a full handoff with training for you and your VA, and you've got two weeks of support after that.\"\n\n**If he needs time:**\n\n> \"Totally understand. I'll send you the full proposal and the deck right after this call — take a look, run the numbers, talk to your wife. Here's what I'd keep in mind: four weeks to build means we need to start soon to be live for peak season. Would Thursday or Friday work for a quick follow-up?\"\n\n**Either way, close with:**\n\n> \"I'm genuinely excited about this, Matthew. You've spent six and a half years building one of the strongest ad systems in the roofing space — hundreds of proven winners, some of the leading ads in the industry, 50 clients on retainer.

And so the dev team that we had was out of Poland. And so like, dude, they came up with using N8N, using virtual machines.  They were able to use browser flow or no ads power for LinkedIn. And then we had LinkedIn recruiter pro.  And then we would. would. would. I'll sign up for, I guess, Sales Navigator, and I want to search, let's say, certain whatever, like Director of Construction, right?  So my goal is I'm going to, right now, I haven't spun up anything. It's just me. I want to basically add this many people, right, the limit that LinkedIn allows, search for, like, let's say, Director, Project Manager for data centers, right?  The staffing that I'm going to do is that I'm going to try to place, like, try to get a contract with him for electricians, if that makes sense, right?  Mm-hmm. So basically, I would go and I would add on LinkedIn, the search would be, like, Manager, data center, you know, or Project Manager, data center.  Instruction, whatever. In the search, add these people, right? And then I want to automate adding them. And then the other part being is sending messages, if that makes sense.  You know, a note, right? Basically, every day, it doesn't have to be massive. And I want to see if that works, then I'm open to getting like Recruiter.  In the previous company, we had Recruiter Pro. And, you know, we spent a good amount on in-mails and things like that, but it was helpful or it was successful to proving it out.  But yeah, that's the goal. Basically, to search for a project manager of a data center construction, right? In the U.S., add them, right?  And then turn around maybe the next day, look at who's been, you know, who I been recently added, right, and then send them a message, preset message, right, to do that.  And there's companies that do this, like I saw, right, like, and so my goal was to, like, see if we can, you know, do this and prove it out and then go from there.  And then I would, you know, because I tested this, so let's say I sent a message, right, LinkedIn message to this guy.  He is a project manager for this company that's helping on an energy or solo project or whatever it was, and then he responded, hey, man, I do need the help.  I don't know who that would be. We work with staffing companies, right, reach out to this person, right? And I said, thank you so much, and then I reached out to that person via phone.  I was able to get a contract, right, for staffing, to staff electricians with that. So I know it works.  And this is basically what I want to do the same for email, which would be basically if I was to identify through LinkedIn, these, these, let's say these project managers for whatever construction, I would want to send them an email also.  Right. And we can, you know, I mean, there's several ways to craft that or, you know, not craft the email, but grab the email, if that makes sense.  Um, and then send them a message like, Hey, I'm Joseph. I work with, you know, whatever staffing, uh, we, we have ready, you know, electricians, like I have the message, right?  Yeah. I've got lots of calls coming now. Um, anyways, and same thing, right? Yeah. And that's it. And then, you know, I want to automate this basically.  Um, and that's it.\n\n8:57 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  You know, we'll be seeing a target, uh, The niche that you're trying to talk about, that's going to be construction companies.  Correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n9:06 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Basically, that hires a... Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah.\n\n9:39 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah. So we are targeting construction companies. And when we say that we want to pitch out the project managers through LinkedIn, is it going to be a one-time job or are we doing it regularly?  No, it'll be repeated, right? So, you know, ideally what happens is, you know, there are, of course, there are going to be some changes.  across the jobs, but let's say there are 10,000 project managers across the world, right? And we can either have, we can either run it one time to get all the 10,000 project managers once, and then we can do the follow-ups over a period of time.  And we can keep updating the database probably monthly. That can be one case. The second case is we, of course, we create a new CRM.  We run it every week. We try to target 100 to 1,000 project managers in a week. And we put the unique, unique one into our CRM, and then we start following up, right?  Those are the two methods that I can think of right now. Yeah.\n\n10:38 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Yeah. Right, right, right. Yeah. We use HubSpot. had sequences in the previous company. Yeah.\n\n10:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So what are we exactly? Go ahead. Go ahead.\n\n10:50 - Joseph Cyriac\n  My, question is again, so you mentioned that this is what you're looking for.\n\n10:54 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So what exactly are the key metrics that we're trying to target from this? How many…\n\n11:00 - Joseph Cyriac\n  We want to get staffing, right? Contracts from companies, right? That's all we want. That's all I want, right? Electricians, that's all I want, right?  In construction. Oh, God, everybody. Oh, go ahead.\n\n11:19 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah. Hi, Joseph.\n\n11:21 - Tushar Mangla\n  Hey, what's up, man? So, yeah, if I summarize, you know, our conversation that you want a system where you will get like some specific target positions of some specific companies or industry, that's a construction company, and you want some of the employees, like project managers, or maybe some other position, right?  Okay, so if I ask you that, you know, like, what's your success metrics look like here?\n\n11:55 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Yeah, I mean, metrics would be, listen, I We would look at response rates, right? Maybe warm up some domains so that if they don't respond, I don't want to get blocked as spam, right?  We're doing mass emails. Success would be like, I don't know, 30% to 40% if I got something like that.  And then out of that 30 to 40% response rate, I was able to get, I don't know, 15% to agree to a, you know, a meeting with me.\n\n12:42 - Tushar Mangla\n  What's the current number? What do you mean current number? I'm sure that you guys are doing it manually if you're doing it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been doing it like every night.\n\n12:55 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So it's about that. I would say it's like, you know, since it's more. Right. I just want them to be involved in the project or, you know what I mean?  Construction level, right? Or in the operations or project management, you know, because you get into sales, right? It doesn't work because let's say somebody's doing sales.  He's like, oh, yeah, you know, you need to talk to someone. So, right. And then operations guy might tell me, it's like, hey, you need to talk to our HR side, right?  Our human resource, right? They do the hiring. And so they do the contracts, right? So things like that.\n\n14:34 - Tushar Mangla\n  So what position will not work for your business? Like, I'm still not getting that understanding of your business, right?  Like, what's your business about? And what's your pitch to them? And what do you think?\n\n14:45 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Hey, yeah, the pitch would be like, hey, I, um, hold on. I had so much. Here, I'm going to pull up, uh, it's  That I use, okay, so one of the guys is like, whatever, hey, John, I want to reach out, introduce myself and my team, we support data center constructions and operations with full electrical labor solutions, right, providing everything from journeyman electricians to performance to QA and QC support, commissioning controls, right, we work on a contract basis, and a contract to firm, right, that means you start as a contractor, and you can get higher contract to higher basis, and we help teams quickly scale quickly for both short and long term site needs.  Would you be available anytime this week, or next week, right? Best, Joe. This was an in-mail, but I could do the same for email, and this guy was in operations, cloud operations, so yeah, go ahead.\n\n16:19 - Tushar Mangla\n  So basically you want the details of those employees who can make the decision for your email or maybe the contract one.  Yeah, and so today I had one, right?\n\n16:31 - Joseph Cyriac\n  He didn't respond. I send that email or in-mail, right? He didn't respond, right? I add him on LinkedIn, right?  Or I send him a message, right? I'll do both. Usually I'll add and send a message, or I'll send a message and add.  It doesn't matter. But the point being is that one guy didn't respond. Then I said, hey, man, or hey, just follow it up, you know, would love to, you know.  come Well, And He then responded back to me and said, hey, I appreciate you following up, right? Because he didn't respond to the first email.  Then he said, hey, I'm the wrong person. I'm a field manager. You actually need to talk to this person, right?  So then, right, it's in there. I took that person, right? Then I went and looked it up, you know, using one of the, you know, the lookup softwares, whatever, right?  I've used all of them. What is it? Rocky Ridge, Seamless, you know, you got Apollo, you got Lush, whatever, right?  I go and look it up. And then I find that guy, right? And in that case, I called that guy.  And then, it worked, right? The guy was like, yeah, dude. Okay, cool. Can you talk to Zach, the field manager?  Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we do need help. With electricians all over the country, whatever, right? And then he said, let's see if we can do, yeah, work together.  Okay.\n\n18:11 - Tushar Mangla\n  So Joseph, as I see that you are saying 20 to 30% reply rate is not that bad, right? If you are expecting 30 to 40, so what exactly is your pain point here?  Yeah, the point is I wanna automate this, right?\n\n18:27 - Joseph Cyriac\n  One, right? I wanna go in, search, automate, right? Then what I wanna do is automate the search part, automate the messaging part, right?  And then I wanna, you know, have followups and everything else and then, you know, drum up new business, right?  That's it, new accounts, right?\n\n18:53 - Tushar Mangla\n  New net logos, right?\n\n18:54 - Joseph Cyriac\n  We say, right, get new business. That's it. Okay.\n\n19:00 - Tushar Mangla\n  So basically, let's say if you can get a system, right, so how, if you could please explain to me currently, how are you searching your current target audience?  Like, what parameters are you giving? Let's say, if you are on the LinkedIn, right? So what, what keywords are you searching?  What's your target audience? How are you defining that these are your exact ICP? Yeah.\n\n19:22 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So, so basically, I'm looking at, it's, I just search right on LinkedIn. And I search for, like I said, director of operations or project management, construction, right?  you know, data center, project manager for data center construction. Like that's a search team I can, I can do in Google.  I mean, not Google, but LinkedIn, right?\n\n19:57 - Tushar Mangla\n  Could you share me like how exactly. You are targeting and filtering your current customers. Sure, sure, sure.\n\n20:09 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So you can see my screen.\n\n20:13 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Okay, cool.\n\n20:14 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So like, okay, so I'm gonna go, let's just do it. All right, okay, so I'm gonna take these guys only in the US, right?  Look at that, and I'm gonna, oh, looks like I'm already connected. No, I'm not connected. So I would want to connect, right?  Send a message, right? And so I'm gonna go here, right? I haven't sent a message. So yeah, this is a premium one, but not like a sales navigator.  But yeah, so basically I would go and send her a message, right? That message that I set about, what is that?  Um, so do you have the sales navigator as well?\n\n21:33 - Tushar Mangla\n  Like if you could please share, if you have, you, I guess, you know, we can get this type of data from that as well.  And we can easily extract the data and automate your whole process. If you're talking about the bulk. Correct.\n\n21:48 - Joseph Cyriac\n  I mean, yeah, I can get sales now. That's not a problem. I just, I don't.\n\n21:53 - Tushar Mangla\n  Got it. So Joseph, if I ask you, let's say, if you got the data of, you know, Tanmay, let's say today, how are you defining your unit?\n\n22:06 - Joseph Cyriac\n  This is your fresh lead. I'm sorry, let's repeat that again.\n\n22:10 - Tushar Mangla\n  Sorry, how are you defining that? Let's say Tanmay is your fresh lead?\n\n22:16 - Joseph Cyriac\n  How am I defining what's a fresh lead? Tanmay.\n\n22:20 - Tushar Mangla\n  So you can see that Tanmay is the first name in the list in the top of the list. He's referring to that.\n\n22:28 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, so he's saying that, how are you defining that Tanmay? He's your fresh lead. How am I defining he is my lead?\n\n22:38 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Yes.\n\n22:40 - Tushar Mangla\n  Fresh lead, I think.\n\n22:41 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So basically, what happens is this, let me just fill in the context. So you, of course, you have maybe contacted 1000 previous project managers.  If you're contacting the next one, 1001 project manager, how are you defining that 1001 project manager is the new one?  So there should be some other parameters as well. For example, I think maybe a fresh lead criteria can be that he is not connected to him.  I think that can be one scenario. Yeah.\n\n23:10 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So, yeah. Yeah. I mean, to your point, right, we can look at, I mean, we could, well, on recruiter side, sorry.  Yeah. Recruiter, used to be able to, to your point, to pick if I've ever messaged him. Is that available in Sales Navigator, if I've messaged them?  The filter that you have messaged him or not? Yeah, yeah. It used to be, it used to be. To, no, that's not it.  I wonder if Sales Navigator used to that. Okay. Anyways, I, if there is a filter, we would use it.  I'm going to, okay, let's just see. totally. But, Yeah, it does. Sales Navigator does. People you interacted with, okay.\n\n24:28 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, recently messaged, exclude leads.\n\n24:31 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So I would use that.\n\n24:34 - Tushar Mangla\n  So Joseph, if I ask a question that you are saying, that if I message them today, what if you get, you know, like, hundreds or thousands of data today?  So when will you again want to contact those persons? Because I'm sure that in one, yeah, yeah, kind of.  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, So. So. So. So.\n\n24:59 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So. So. So. So. So. I would say it's like, you know, I would want to follow up, like, within a week.  So if I sent, let's say, her a message, right? I would want to send her a message, right? A week later, right?  Okay.\n\n25:23 - Tushar Mangla\n  And how much data are you expecting in one day? Well, so here's the thing, right?\n\n25:30 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So I'm, I'm gonna, so this was my old company that I left. But anyway, so basically, what I would want to do is, is, I mean, I just want to test this out initially, and then I'm willing to scale if it works, right?\n\n25:48 - Tushar Mangla\n  That's it.\n\n25:50 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So like, if it's, if it's, if, if we'll test this out with Sales Navigator, I'm happy to buy it.  And then if it's, if the response rate is good. Right. it Initially, shoot, don't need, I don't even find, we don't even have to do 40%.  We can give it a 20% response rate, right? And then from there, so if they respond, right, that's 20% response rate.  Then if I can get to 12% of booking a meeting, I would consider that a win, right? So they respond, I want 20% response rate, right?  Hey, not interested, blah, blah, right? Or, hey, right, not a good time, whatever. Or you need to, you have the wrong person, reach out to this person, right?  That's what I would want to do, right? So that's 20%. Then I would want 10% to 12% of, hey, yeah, hey, we're interested.  Or, hey, you need to, yeah, you know, let's meet. I can meet two weeks from now, right? So that's a success.  That's a win, right? So that would count towards the 10%, 10 to 12%, if that makes sense.\n\n27:05 - Tushar Mangla\n  So you're saying that 10 to 12% is a win for you. So is this from LinkedIn DMs or from the email replied?  So here's the thing, right?\n\n27:16 - Joseph Cyriac\n  I would want LinkedIn and we test this with LinkedIn email. And then we would do this also, we can do this with email.  Sure. You know, I guess there is a limit of LinkedIn that you can automatically, right?\n\n27:31 - Tushar Mangla\n  I was 25 per week, right? 100, 100 per week, I think. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So that's for sales navigator.\n\n27:39 - Joseph Cyriac\n  No, so using LinkedIn for new people.\n\n27:41 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  think you can reach out a hundred people. think that's a soft limit that they automatically sending in the connection request.\n\n27:46 - Tushar Mangla\n  Yes. Okay. Oh, that's it a week. Okay. Yeah. So that's why let's say if, you know, will start from the email part because that's the very easy solution.  And. You know, so if you start from the LinkedIn, so what number are you expecting from one day that if we target top decision maker of any company, right?  So how many emails are you expecting that you will get one day? 100,000 or 5,000? What do we have a number?  So let's just go with what LinkedIn allows, right?\n\n28:23 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So you said I get 100 connects a week. Is that right? Yeah. And then how many emails do I get?\n\n28:30 - Tushar Mangla\n  You know, now you get like, I guess email exception is not dependent on the LinkedIn, but he's talking about the LinkedIn in me.\n\n28:39 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So for that, I think there's a credit plan. I think it's going to be 50 or 60 in mail that you can send.\n\n28:50 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Credits. Okay. Yeah, I know about that. You can get more credits, I think.\n\n29:08 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  This is exactly 50 on a monthly basis. So maybe you can use multiple.\n\n29:14 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So if there is sales navigator, it is going to be 150. Message. Is that 150 a month? Yeah. Monthly basis.  Wow. Okay. That's it. LinkedIn is horrible. we would need to. Oh, man. Yeah, that's what CurtaPro included. Actually a lot more.  Anyways, cool. So what we would do here is that we would test Yeah, let's test with LinkedIn, right? Basically.  Yeah, I would want to test with LinkedIn and then that's there. Here's another And we could, it's going to be, of course, it's to be cheaper to do an email, right?\n\n30:06 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah. Yeah. Cause so we would search with LinkedIn, get their email.\n\n30:12 - Joseph Cyriac\n  How many connects max can I do on, on, uh, you know, we can do a hundred connects. That's it.  Yes. Yes. Cause what I was thinking was like, we would search for them, connect with them. So that, yeah.  So that won't even matter. Cause I was thinking it's like, yeah. Okay, cool. we can do this.\n\n30:36 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  We can use multiple accounts, multiple parallel accounts. I know, I know I did that.\n\n30:41 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Uh, we rented accounts really. Yeah. Um, okay. Keep going. Um, yeah, I think that the best easiest scalable way to do this is, uh, uh, uh, uh, wanna.  All I out kind of initially on whatever, my LinkedIn, whatever it is, to send, yeah, to your point, I want to test out on the email side, right, sending them a message, right, and then sending, grabbing their email, and then sending an email also.  Yeah, I think it will have to be both ways.\n\n31:26 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Because in the email, we can send as much as we want, right?\n\n31:29 - Joseph Cyriac\n  I mean, can do 10,000, whatever, right?\n\n31:32 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, so what I see, what I actually suggest in this scenario is, let's say we are able to fetch 1,000 project managers in a week, right, and that way, I would like to connect 100, top 100 project managers that matches to my understanding, you know, that those are easier to connect with, and high conversion rate candidates, I will simply connect with them on LinkedIn, and the rest 900, I will actually try to reach out to on email.  Okay. So, so it's going to be both. Thank\n\n32:03 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Yeah.\n\n32:03 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  the, uh, hundred connects that we do, and then we're going to send the DMS as well as the in mails and everything, because there's two ways.  See, there is a LinkedIn in mail. That is, if you are not even connected to them, you can send them any, uh, DM.  There is also when you connect with the link, uh, with someone on LinkedIn, then you can send a free DMS, right?  And you don't have to use email. So it is going to be upwards or north of 150, uh, DMs easily because we have the in mail credits.  Sure. Those are two things that I am actually considering. So, uh, and you know, our, our target is going to be two fronts.  The thing is, if you're trying to get, let's say, 10 or 20 or 50 good candy, you know, converted leads into your funnel, then I believe either we can try to target a hundred leads and try to convert those hundred out to 50.  Or what we can do is we can target 1000 leads. We can try it on multiple.\n\n34:00 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Right? LinkedIn is what people use for, I mean, you know, people get all kinds of emails, right? LinkedIn is a little bit, you know, there's less emails, right?  Oh, okay.\n\n34:14 - Tushar Mangla\n  I think from LinkedIn, should be higher conversion rate, right?\n\n34:17 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Exactly.\n\n34:17 - Joseph Cyriac\n  That's the hope. That's kind of what I've seen, right? Hey, you're not interested. Okay, cool. Right?\n\n34:25 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So I'll be, Joseph, I think you mentioned that you were working with a company and now you are trying it out on your own.  Okay.\n\n34:32 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Yeah. So I'm not with VeroSkills, right? I'm not with VeroSkills. I'm branching out on my own. So that's what I'm needing to do.  That's why like, that's why like, I'm reaching out to you guys, you know, I was on Upwork, right? Some guy from Pakistan was like, dude, we could do all this, you know, blah, blah.\n\n34:53 - Tushar Mangla\n  Same thing.\n\n34:54 - Joseph Cyriac\n  So, so I'm just kind of looking at cost is important to me as I prove this out.\n\n35:00 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  And how did you get my Calendly? I'm just, I'm also curious in that. Yeah, of course. I saw Tushar, you too.\n\n35:07 - Joseph Cyriac\n  You guys were both in like, I think you guys post on Reddit, right? Yeah.\n\n35:13 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  And then I saw on, what is that?\n\n35:15 - Joseph Cyriac\n  The N8N Facebook group, was it? Must be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you just graduated, right? College or something, right?  You started this small, what is the company? I forget what you hit. Yeah, yeah. Very good. Great. Great job.  So Joseph, you mentioned the Reddit part, like, what's that about? Sorry, go ahead.\n\n35:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  I think you mentioned Reddit as well as Facebook. So, yeah.\n\n35:54 - Tushar Mangla\n  Like, where basically did you get, you know, is a Prakash Calendary link? So I'm just curious. I'm sorry, what's that like from where did you get the precursor any link that you mentioned Reddit, then YouTube?  I think it was Facebook, right?\n\n36:12 - Joseph Cyriac\n  Yeah, because I was here. I think you posted about Tushar, you do recruiting or something, right? Yeah, so like this guy, he's on Upwork and we sat to him and we've worked with a few from my previous company there.  And so I think you guys are in here. did that. And then that was one way I was able to do that.  Reddit, there's, yeah, there's quite a few. So, hey, I got to run guys, okay? So set up the next meeting, let's come up with a plan.  Okay. To kick this model off.\n\n36:59 - Tushar Mangla\n  Okay. That's it. So when are you available for the next meeting, I guess, you know, let's do one tomorrow, let's do one tomorrow.  Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. That's good, guys. I appreciate it. All right. Bye bye. All right. Get some sleep.  Yeah. All right.

The Market Opportunity**\nWe'll pull up your exact ICP live - Project Managers, Directors, Field Leads in data center construction across the US - and show you how big the addressable market actually is. We'll also show you something we think is a game-changer: companies that are actively posting jobs for electricians right now. These are the warmest possible leads because they literally need what you sell today.\n\n**2. Multi-Channel Outreach System**\nWe'll walk through how we hit prospects from two directions:\n- **LinkedIn:** Automated connection requests, DMs, and follow-ups (within LinkedIn's limits)\n- **Email at Scale:** Multiple sending domains with warm-up, so you're reaching 300-500+ people per day by email - not 10-20\n\nWe'll show you the exact 7-touch follow-up funnel we'd run - each email takes a different angle (direct pitch, social proof, pain point, referral ask, case study, breakup). Industry data shows most replies come on touches 3-7, and right now you're only doing 1-2.\n\n**3. Finding Emails That Actually Work**\nWe'll demo how we use waterfall enrichment (Clay) to find 70-85% of emails for your lead list, compared to ~50% from a single tool like Apollo. More found emails = more people you can reach.\n\n**4. What Happens When They Respond**\nThe part you care most about - how responses get to you instantly, how referrals get auto-tracked (like the \"wrong person, talk to X\" scenario), and how everything flows into HubSpot so nothing falls through the cracks.\n\n**5. Pricing & Timeline**\nWe'll break down the tool costs, our service options, and what the realistic timeline looks like to go from zero to leads hitting your inbox.\n\nIf there's anything else you'd like us to cover, let me know.\n\nTalk tomorrow,\nPrakarsh\n","size":"2.1 KB","path":"Joseph/02_followup_email.md"},{"filename":"03_requirement_analysis.md","title":"Requirement Analysis","content":"# Joseph Cyriac - Lead Generation System Design\n\n> **Date:** February 13, 2026\n> **Call Date:** February 12, 2026\n> **Client:** Joseph Cyriac\n> **Business:** Electrical Staffing (Data Center Construction)\n> **Geography:** United States & related areas\n> **End Goal:** Maximum volume of construction company leads (PMs, Directors, Field Leads) into his pipeline\n\n---\n\n## 1. THE REAL OPPORTUNITY\n\nJoseph is doing outreach manually every night and getting results. His pitch converts. The problem isn't his message - it's his reach. He's limited to however many LinkedIn searches and messages he can do before bed.\n\n**What Joseph told us he wants:** Automate LinkedIn search + messages + follow-ups.\n\n**What Joseph actually needs:** A lead generation machine that puts 1,000+ construction decision-makers into his pipeline every month, with an automated follow-up funnel that nurtures them until they either book a meeting or say no.\n\n**Our job is not to automate what he's doing. Our job is to 10x his pipeline.**\n\n---\n\n## 2.

PHASE 1 - OUTREACH CHANNELS\n\n### Channel 1: LinkedIn Connection Requests\n\n**Volume:** ~100 connections/week (20/day, 5 days/week)\n**Tool:** Phantombuster or Heyreach\n\n```\nCONNECTION REQUEST NOTE (300 char limit):\n──────────────────────────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}}, I work with data center contractors who need\nlicensed electricians on short notice. We provide crews on a\ncontract basis - typically on site within 2 weeks. Would love\nto connect in case it's ever useful.\n```\n\n**After they accept:**\n\n```\nDM (Day 2 after accept):\n──────────────────────────\nThanks for connecting, {{first_name}}!\n\nQuick question - does {{company}} ever use contract electricians\non your data center/construction projects?\n\nWe provide licensed crews and can usually have people on site\nwithin 1-2 weeks. Happy to share more if relevant.\n```\n\n```\nDM FOLLOW-UP (Day 7 after accept, if no reply):\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}}, just circling back. If you ever need to\nscale your electrical crew quickly for a project, we might\nbe a good fit. No pressure - happy to chat whenever timing\nmakes sense.\n```\n\n### Channel 2: LinkedIn InMail\n\n**Volume:** 50-150/month (depending on Sales Nav vs Recruiter Pro)\n**Best used for:** High-value leads who don't accept connection requests\n\n```\nINMAIL:\n────────\nSubject: Electricians for {{company}}'s projects\n\nHi {{first_name}},\n\n{{ai_personalized_line}}\n\nWe provide licensed electricians for data center and commercial\nconstruction on a contract basis - typically can have a crew on\nsite within 2 weeks.\n\nIf {{company}} ever needs to scale the electrical side of a\nproject quickly, I'd love to share how we help teams like yours.\n\nWorth a quick chat?\n\nJoe\n```\n\n**InMail strategy:**\n- Use InMails for leads who haven't accepted connection requests after 7 days\n- Prioritize InMail for VP/Director-level titles (higher value, lower connect acceptance)\n- Track InMail response rate separately - it's typically higher than cold email (10-25%)\n\n### Channel 3: Cold Email (Multi-Account)\n\n**Volume:** 360-450 emails/day across 9 accounts (ramping over 5 weeks)\n\n#### Multi-Email Infrastructure\n\nSingle email account = 50 cold emails/day max before spam risk. Joseph needs 200-500+ emails/day. Solution: multiple domains, multiple accounts per domain, all warmed up and sending in rotation.\n\n```\nPRIMARY DOMAIN (Joseph's real business):\n  josephstaffing.com (or whatever his domain is)\n  - This is for REPLIES ONLY. Never cold email from the main domain.\n\nSENDING DOMAINS (lookalike domains for cold outreach):\n  Domain 1: josephstaffingsolutions.com\n    ├── joe@josephstaffingsolutions.com\n    ├── joseph@josephstaffingsolutions.com\n    └── jcyriac@josephstaffingsolutions.com\n\n  Domain 2: josephelectricalstaffing.com\n    ├── joe@josephelectricalstaffing.com\n    ├── joseph@josephelectricalstaffing.com\n    └── jcyriac@josephelectricalstaffing.com\n\n  Domain 3: josephlaborsolutions.com\n    ├── joe@josephlaborsolutions.com\n    ├── joseph@josephlaborsolutions.com\n    └── jcyriac@josephlaborsolutions.com\n```\n\n#### Email Infrastructure Numbers (Phase 1):\n\n| Domains | Accounts/Domain | Total Accounts | Emails/Account/Day | Total Emails/Day | Total/Month |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|\n| 3 | 3 | 9 | 40-50 | 360-450 | 8,000-10,000 |\n\n#### Domain Setup Checklist (per domain):\n- [ ] Register domain (~$10-12/year)\n- [ ] Set up Google Workspace ($6/user/month) OR Zoho Mail ($1/user/month)\n- [ ] Configure SPF record\n- [ ] Configure DKIM record\n- [ ] Configure DMARC record\n- [ ] Add to Instantly.ai for warm-up (minimum 14 days before sending)\n- [ ] Set up forwarding so all replies go to Joseph's main inbox\n\n#### Warm-up Timeline:\n```\nWeek 1-2:  Warm-up only (Instantly handles this automatically)\nWeek 3:    Start sending 10-15 emails/account/day\nWeek 4:    Ramp to 25-30 emails/account/day\nWeek 5+:   Full volume 40-50 emails/account/day\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. PHASE 1 - EMAIL SEQUENCES (7-Touch Funnel)\n\nJoseph's current approach is 1 message + maybe 1 follow-up. That leaves massive value on the table. Industry data shows most conversions happen on touches 3-7.\n\n### Sequence A: Direct Outreach (For ICP-matched leads from LinkedIn)\n\n```\nDAY 1: THE OPENER (Direct value prop)\n─────────────────────────────────────\nSubject: Electricians for {{company}}'s projects\n─────────────────────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}},\n\n{{ai_personalized_line}}\n\nWe provide licensed electricians for data center and commercial construction\non a contract or contract-to-hire basis - typically can have a crew on\nsite within 2 weeks.\n\nWorth a quick chat?\n\nJoe\n```\n\n```\nDAY 3: THE FOLLOW-UP (Short bump)\n─────────────────────────────────\nSubject: Re: Electricians for {{company}}'s projects\n─────────────────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}},\n\nJust bumping this up.

We work with teams who can't wait 6-8 weeks\nfor traditional hiring to fill roles.\n\nContract staffing gets licensed electricians on site in 1-2 weeks without\nthe overhead of full-time hires.\n\nIf this resonates, happy to share more.\n\nJoe\n```\n\n```\nDAY 18: THE REFERRAL ASK (If they're not the right person)\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSubject: Quick question, {{first_name}}\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}},\n\nI've reached out a few times about electrical staffing for {{company}}'s\nconstruction projects. I realize you might not be the right person for this.\n\nCould you point me to whoever handles contractor/staffing decisions on the\nconstruction side?

We had a full crew\ndeployed in 12 days. Project stayed on schedule.\n\nIf {{company}} ever faces something similar, we're a phone call away.\n\nJoe\n```\n\n```\nDAY 30: THE BREAKUP (Creates urgency)\n─────────────────────────────────────\nSubject: Closing your file, {{first_name}}\n─────────────────────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}},\n\nI'll assume the timing isn't right and this will be my last email.\n\nIf things change down the road and you need electrical labor\nfor construction projects, feel free to reach back out.\n\nWishing you the best,\nJoe\n\nP.S.

Phase 2 is about one thing: **your competitors are only on LinkedIn. We're going to be everywhere your buyers are — before they even know they need you.**\n\nConstruction decision-makers don't just live on LinkedIn. They're posting jobs on niche boards, bidding on projects, browsing trade directories, talking in Reddit threads, attending conferences, and scrolling Facebook groups. Phase 2 puts Joseph in front of them on every single one of these surfaces.\n\n**Phase 2 also expands services:** not just electricians anymore — plumbers and other skilled trades too.\n\n---\n\n## 14. PHASE 2 - THE FULL PLATFORM MAP\n\nWe've identified **7 categories** of platforms where construction PMs, Directors, and VPs actively spend time. Each one is a lead source we can scrape, monitor, or engage on.\n\n### CATEGORY 1: Job Boards (Highest Intent Leads)\n\nThese companies are literally advertising that they need what Joseph sells. A company posting \"Hiring 5 electricians for data center project\" is the warmest possible lead.\n\n| Platform | What It Is | Who's There | Scrapable? | Lead Volume |\n|----------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| **Indeed** | Largest US job board | Every construction company hiring trades | Yes - Apify scraper | 500-2,000 job posts/month for electricians + plumbers |\n| **LinkedIn Jobs** | Professional job board | Same companies, often cross-posted from Indeed | Yes - Apify scraper | 300-1,000 job posts/month |\n| **Trade Hounds** | App-based network for contractors and skilled trades. Contractors post jobs, review profiles with photos/videos | Field managers, contractors actively hiring trades (~100k+ users) | Public job listings, app data accessible via profiles | 100-400 contacts/month |\n| **iHireConstruction** | Niche construction/skilled trades job board with resume database | PMs posting for on-site roles, ops directors | Employer access via subscription, resume database | Thousands of listings, focused audience |\n| **ConstructionJobs** | Dedicated construction worker site with resume database | GCs doing targeted hiring for trades | Premium employer tools, no public directory | Highly defined trades hiring audience |\n| **Roadtechs.com** | Job board for traveling contractors including construction | Utilities/power project managers, traveling crew leads | Public job postings, job alert tools | Niche but relevant for utilities/power vertical |\n\n**How we use them:** Apify scrapes all these boards daily for keywords like \"electrician,\" \"plumber,\" \"skilled trades\" + \"data center,\" \"construction,\" \"commissioning.\" For each company found, Clay/Apollo finds the PM/Director contact -> send intent-based Sequence B.\n\n**The pitch that writes itself:**\n> \"I saw you're hiring electricians for your data center project. We can provide 5-10 licensed electricians within 2 weeks on a contract basis - faster than a traditional hiring process.\"\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 2: Industry Directories & Databases (Targeted Company Lists)\n\nThese are curated lists of verified construction companies. Instead of searching blindly, we scrape the directories and find the decision-makers inside each company.\n\n| Directory | What It Is | Who's Listed | Scrapable? | Lead Volume |\n|-----------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| **ENR Top 400/500** | Engineering News-Record annual ranking of top contractors by revenue. Covers data centers, industrial, solar | Largest firms in the US — VPs, Directors, PMs at companies doing $100M+ in revenue | Public lists online, downloadable PDFs, no API | 400-500 companies -> 2,000-5,000 contacts (one-time, refreshed annually) |\n| **ABC Member Directories** | Associated Builders and Contractors — chapter-by-chapter member lists. Merit-shop contractors including renewables | ~600+ member firms per chapter, covering commercial, industrial, data center contractors | Online searchable directories per chapter | Hundreds of chapters -> thousands of companies nationwide |\n| **ConWize Directory** | US construction contractors database searchable by trade and location. Self-updated by firms | Builders, EPC firms, suppliers across commercial and industrial | Public searchable directory | Broad coverage of active US construction pros |\n| **AGC Member Directory** | Associated General Contractors of America — largest US construction trade association (33,000+ member firms) | GC directors, ops VPs, PMs at the biggest general contractors in the country | Online directories by chapter, nationwide network | 33,000+ firms -> massive contact pool |\n| **Apollo.io Database** | B2B contact database with ICP filters | Bulk search by title + industry + company size + geography | API via N8N or Clay | 2,000-5,000 leads per search |\n\n**How we use them:**\n1. Scrape each directory to build a master list of target companies\n2. For each company, use Clay/Apollo to find the PM, Director, VP contacts\n3. Enrich with email + LinkedIn profile\n4. Feed into outreach sequences\n\n**This gives us a one-time foundation of 5,000-10,000+ target companies across the US** — then we work through them systematically.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 3: Project Tracking & Bid Databases (Real-Time Buying Signals)\n\nThese platforms show **who is actively winning construction contracts and building right now.** A company that just won a $50M data center project will need electricians. We reach out before they even post the job.\n\n| Platform | What It Is | Signal We Get | Scrapable? | Lead Volume |\n|----------|------------|---------------|------------|-------------|\n| **ConstructConnect** | Real-time bids and project tracking — commercial, data centers, industrial. 100,000+ users, daily updates | Which companies are bidding on / winning projects that need electrical/plumbing work | Subscription database with bidder lists, API available | Ongoing stream of active projects |\n| **PlanHub** | Subcontractor bidding platform — GCs post projects for trades like electrical and plumbing. Hundreds of thousands of contractors | GCs actively looking for electrical/plumbing subs for specific projects | Public project search, integrated bidding tools | Direct access to GCs seeking trades |\n| **BuildZoom** | Connects contractors to projects/clients, tracks project leads and permits | Which contractors are actively building and may need to scale crews | Public profiles and project data, data export possible | Ongoing project-level signals |\n\n**Why this is powerful:** Instead of cold outreach, we can say:\n> \"Congratulations on the [Project Name] award. When you're ramping up the electrical crew for that project, we can have licensed electricians on site within 2 weeks.\"\n\nThis is second only to job board intent in warmth — they haven't posted a job yet, but we know they'll need people.\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 4: Trade Associations (Curated Decision-Maker Networks)\n\nThese are the professional organizations that construction leaders actually belong to. Their member directories are gold mines of verified, title-matched contacts.\n\n| Association | Focus Area | Members | Directory Access |\n|-------------|-----------|---------|-----------------|\n| **AGC (Associated General Contractors)** | General construction — the biggest US association | 33,000+ member firms — GC directors, ops VPs, construction managers | Online directories by chapter, nationwide |\n| **ABC (Associated Builders and Contractors)** | Merit-shop / open-shop contractors — commercial, industrial, renewables | ~600+ firms per chapter, hundreds of chapters | Public online directories per chapter |\n| **SEIA (Solar Energy Industries Association)** | Solar and renewable energy | Solar PMs, utilities decision-makers, construction managers in renewables | State-by-state filterable member maps/directories, some public |\n| **NECA (National Electrical Contractors Association)** | Electrical contractors specifically | The companies Joseph's clients subcontract from/to | Chapter-based member directories |\n| **MCAA (Mechanical Contractors Association)** | Mechanical/plumbing contractors | Plumbing and HVAC contractor decision-makers | Member directories by chapter |\n\n**How we use them:**\n- Scrape member directories for company names\n- Cross-reference with Clay/Apollo to find individual contacts (PM, Director, VP)\n- These leads are high quality — verified industry membership = real companies in construction\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 5: Forums & Online Communities (Warm Engagement Leads)\n\nThese are places where PMs and field managers talk openly about their challenges — including hiring pain, project delays, and labor shortages. Monitoring these gives us warm signals and conversation starters.\n\n| Community | Platform | Who's Active | How to Use It |\n|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|\n| **r/Construction** | Reddit | Field managers, PMs, GC employees discussing projects and challenges | Monitor for hiring/labor shortage posts -> identify company -> outreach |\n| **r/ConstructionManagers** | Reddit | PMs and construction managers sharing resources, templates, challenges | Same — warm signals from people openly discussing staffing pain |\n| **r/electricians** | Reddit | Electricians and electrical contractors | Monitor for contractor-side discussions about staffing needs |\n| **r/SkilledTrades** | Reddit | Broad skilled trades community | Identify companies and people discussing labor challenges |\n| **Planning Planet Forum** | Web forum | Planners, schedulers, PMs in construction (US-heavy) | Monitor project discussions, identify decision-makers |\n| **Facebook Groups** (electrical/construction) | Facebook | Regional groups for trades hiring, code discussions, job postings | Search \"electrician construction US\" — tons of regional groups where companies post needs |\n| **LinkedIn Groups** | LinkedIn | Decision-makers in industry-specific groups (Construction, Data Center, Electrical) | Engage in discussions, then connect/DM — warmer than cold outreach |\n\n**How we use them:**\n- Set up monitoring (manual or automated) for keywords: \"hiring electricians,\" \"need electricians,\" \"short-staffed,\" \"labor shortage,\" \"staffing\"\n- When someone posts about needing trades labor -> find their company -> find the decision-maker -> outreach\n- Response from forum monitoring converts at 2-3x cold outreach because you're referencing a real, stated need\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 6: Review & Vendor Matching Platforms\n\nPlatforms where GCs actively look for subcontractors and staffing providers.\n\n| Platform | What It Is | Opportunity |\n|----------|------------|-------------|\n| **PlanHub** | GCs post projects and invite subs to bid — integrated vendor matching and directory | Joseph can list as a staffing vendor AND scrape to find GCs actively seeking electrical/plumbing subs |\n| **PreconSuite Directory** | Searchable subcontractor/supplier database built since 2002. \"Find Me More\" tool used by estimators and PMs | Get listed so GCs find Joseph; also scrape for GC contacts who are actively sourcing subs |\n\n**Dual use:** These platforms are both a lead source (scrape GC contacts) AND a presence play (get listed so inbound leads find Joseph).\n\n---\n\n### CATEGORY 7: Conferences & Trade Shows (High-Value Face Time)\n\nEvents where senior decision-makers congregate. Many publish attendee or exhibitor lists before/after the event — which we can use for targeted outreach.\n\n| Event | Focus | Attendees | List Access |\n|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|\n| **Intersolar & Energy Storage North America (IESNA)** | Premier US solar/EV/storage show | Thousands of attendees — PMs from renewables, utilities, solar construction | Exhibitor lists public; attendee data by state available post-event |\n| **ENR FutureTech** | Construction technology and innovation | Senior construction execs, directors, VPs | Attendee/speaker lists |\n| **NECA Convention** | Electrical contractors national event | Electrical contractor decision-makers across the US | Exhibitor and attendee access |\n| **ABC Convention** | Open-shop contractors national event | Construction directors, PMs, ops VPs | Chapter and national attendee lists |\n| **Data Center World** | Data center construction, operations, design | Data center PMs, directors, ops managers | Exhibitor lists, some attendee data |\n\n**How we use them:**\n- **Pre-event:** Scrape exhibitor/attendee lists -> outreach with \"I see you'll be at [Event] — would love to connect about how we staff electrical crews for [their type of project]\"\n- **Post-event:** Follow up with attendees who didn't connect -> \"We were both at [Event] last week...\"\n- Even if Joseph doesn't attend, the lists are still valuable for targeted outreach\n\n---\n\n## 15. PHASE 2 - LEAD VOLUME SUMMARY\n\n| Source Category | Platforms | Leads/Month | Lead Quality | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------|\n| **Job Boards** (intent scraping) | Indeed, LinkedIn Jobs, Trade Hounds, iHireConstruction, ConstructionJobs, Roadtechs | 200-800 contacts | **Highest** — actively hiring | Warmest outreach angle |\n| **Industry Directories** | ENR, ABC, AGC, ConWize, Apollo | 500-2,000 (ongoing from one-time scrapes) | **High** — verified companies | Foundation lists |\n| **Project/Bid Databases** | ConstructConnect, PlanHub, BuildZoom | 100-400 project signals | **Very High** — actively building | \"Congrats on the project\" angle |\n| **Trade Associations** | AGC, ABC, SEIA, NECA, MCAA | 300-1,000 (from member directories) | **High** — verified members | Cross-reference with Clay for contacts |\n| **Forums & Communities** | Reddit, Facebook Groups, LinkedIn Groups, Planning Planet | 50-200 warm signals | **Very High** — stated needs | Monitor + engage |\n| **Vendor Platforms** | PlanHub, PreconSuite | 50-100 inbound | **High** — actively sourcing subs | Dual: scrape + get listed |\n| **Conferences** | IESNA, NECA, ABC, Data Center World | Event-dependent (200-500 per event) | **Very High** — senior decision-makers | Pre/post-event outreach |\n| **LinkedIn** (continued from Phase 1) | Sales Nav / Recruiter Pro | 600/month (multi-account) | **High** | Phase 1 engine keeps running |\n| **Total Phase 2** | | **2,000-6,000/month** | | |\n\n---\n\n## 16. PHASE 2 - EXPANDED SERVICES\n\nPhase 2 broadens from \"electricians only\" to multiple skilled trades:\n\n| Trade | Target Verticals | Pitch Angle |\n|-------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **Electricians** (continued) | Data center, solar, commercial, utilities | Same as Phase 1 — proven messaging |\n| **Plumbers** | Commercial construction, industrial, manufacturing | \"Licensed plumbing crews for commercial projects on a contract basis\" |\n| **Other Skilled Trades** | General construction, industrial | \"Skilled labor crews — electricians, plumbers, HVAC — on site in 1-2 weeks\" |\n\nThis means new email sequences and LinkedIn messaging tailored to each trade, plus intent scraping on job boards now covers plumber and HVAC keywords too.\n\n---\n\n## 17. PHASE 2 - INTENT-BASED OUTREACH (Sequence B)\n\nFor leads found through job board scraping, project databases, or forum monitoring — companies with a **stated or visible need** for skilled trades.\n\n```\nDAY 1: THE INTENT OPENER\n─────────────────────────\nSubject: Saw you're hiring electricians\n─────────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}},\n\nI noticed {{company}} has an open role for electricians\non your {{project_type}} project.\n\nWe provide licensed electrical crews on a contract basis -\ntypically can have people on site within 2 weeks, without\nthe overhead of traditional hiring.\n\nWould it help to chat about how contract staffing could\nsupplement your hiring?\n\nJoe\n```\n\n```\nDAY 3: THE SPEED ANGLE\n──────────────────────\nSubject: Re: Saw you're hiring electricians\n──────────────────────\nHi {{first_name}},\n\nFollowing up - I know hiring electricians can take 6-8 weeks\nthrough traditional channels. Our contract model fills positions\nin 1-2 weeks because we have pre-vetted crews ready to deploy.\n\nIf speed matters for your current project, happy to jump on\na 10-min call.\n\nJoe\n```\n\n```\n(Continue with touches 3-7 similar to Sequence A but referencing\nthe active hiring need throughout)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 18.

Right now you're reaching 50/month.\"\n\n2. **\"Here's how we find their emails\"**\n   - Live Clay demo: Take 10 leads from Sales Nav, run waterfall enrichment\n   - Show: \"Apollo found 5 emails, Prospeo found 2 more, Hunter found 1 more = 8 out of 10\"\n   - \"Instead of finding 50% of emails, we find 80%\"\n\n3. **\"Here's what they'll receive\"**\n   - Walk through the 7-touch email sequence\n   - Show the LinkedIn Connect + InMail + Email coordination timeline\n   - \"You're touching each person up to 11 times across two channels over 30 days\"\n\n4. **\"Here's what happens when they respond\"**\n   - Show HubSpot pipeline\n   - Show the notification setup: \"You'll get a WhatsApp ping within minutes\"\n   - Show the referral workflow: \"When someone says 'talk to our HR,' we automatically find that person\"\n\n5. **\"Here's the infrastructure\"**\n   - Show the multi-domain email setup\n   - Explain warm-up: \"We start with 3 domains, 9 accounts, sending 350+ emails/day\"\n   - Show Instantly dashboard\n\n6. **\"Here's the phased plan\"**\n   - Phase 1: LinkedIn sourcing + LinkedIn/InMail/Email outreach (~$500/month)\n   - Phase 2: Add 6 categories of new lead sources (job boards, directories, project databases, trade associations, forums, conferences), expand to plumbers and other trades (~$900-1,200/month)\n   - First responses expected in week 3-4\n\n---\n\n## 22. QUESTIONS FOR TOMORROW'S CALL\n\n1. **Does Joseph have a business domain?** If gmail only, we need to register his main domain too.\n2. **Sales Navigator or Recruiter Pro?** Does he already have either? Preference?\n3. **What's his total addressable market?** Just data centers or also solar, commercial, industrial?\n4. **Beyond electricians?** Does he already staff plumbers or other trades, or is that a future expansion?\n5. **Can he handle 18-35 meetings/month?** Or does he need to hire/contract someone to help qualify?\n6. **Budget:** Is $500/month for Phase 1 tools workable? (Compare to: 1 contract pays for 1-2 years of tools)\n7. **Existing contacts:** Does he have any past leads/contacts from VeroSkills he can import?\n8. **Timeline:** When does he want first outreach going out? (We can start warm-up immediately)\n9. **Case studies/proof:** Does he have any past success stories we can use in the email sequence?\n\n---\n\n## 23.

The goal is to show Joseph not what he asked for, but what's possible - and why the investment in a proper system pays for itself with a single contract.*\n","size":"49.7 KB","path":"Joseph/03_requirement_analysis.md"},{"filename":"04_sales_script.md","title":"Sales Script","content":"# Joseph Cyriac - Sales Call Pitch\n\n> **Call Date:** February 13, 2026\n> **Prepared for:** Second call with Joseph (follow-up from Feb 12 discovery call)\n> **Call Length:** Target 45 minutes\n> **Objective:** Close Joseph on Phase 1 engagement in one call, plant the seed for Phase 2\n\n---\n\n## PRE-CALL INTEL (What We Know From Call #1)\n\nBefore you open your mouth, remember who Joseph is:\n\n| What We Know | Why It Matters |\n|---|---|\n| **Solo founder** — just left VeroSkills, branching out on his own | He's bootstrapping. Every dollar matters. But he's also hungry — he's doing outreach every night manually |\n| **His pitch converts** — he already closed a contract from manual LinkedIn outreach | The system works. He just needs scale. This is NOT someone who needs to validate his offer |\n| **He proved the referral chain** — someone said \"wrong person, talk to X\" and that turned into a contract | Referrals are his highest-converting channel. Our system automates this |\n| **Cost-sensitive** — \"cost is important to me as I prove this out\" | Don't lead with a $5,000/month number. Show ROI first, then price becomes irrelevant |\n| **Found us on Reddit/Facebook** — not a high-ticket inbound lead | He's shopping. He talked to a guy on Upwork from Pakistan. We need to position above \"dev shop\" immediately |\n| **We already built this system for another client** — Apollo + LinkedIn sourcing, LinkedIn connect -> wait -> DM, email with multi-step follow-ups + auto-stop on reply | This is our single biggest credibility card. Use it as PROOF, not a feature list. Drop it in Pillar 2 and the close. |\n| **His success metrics**: 20% response rate, 10-12% meeting booking rate | These are reasonable. Our system will exceed them. Use HIS numbers in the pitch |\n| **Uses HubSpot** — had sequences at VeroSkills | Familiar with CRM. Not starting from zero |\n| **Wants LinkedIn + Email** — already told us his channel preferences | Don't oversell channels he didn't ask for. Give him what he wants, but frame it bigger |\n\n---\n\n## THE CALL STRUCTURE\n\n```\nSTEP 1: SET THE FRAME (5 min)\n    |\n    v\nSTEP 2: DISCOVERY - ROLLER COASTER (15 min)\n    Future State Goals (where do you want to be?)\n    --> Current State Pain (what's stopping you?)\n    |\n    v\nSTEP 3: THREE-PILLAR PITCH (10 min)\n    Pillar 1: Lead Sourcing at Scale\n    Pillar 2: Multi-Channel Outreach That Runs Without You\n    Pillar 3: Response Handling That Closes Deals Faster\n    |\n    v\nSTEP 4: PHASE 2 TEASE (3 min)\n    Plant the seed for expansion\n    |\n    v\nSTEP 5: PRICING & TIMELINE (5 min)\n    Value stack --> Price drop --> Silence\n    |\n    v\nSTEP 6: CLOSE (5 min)\n    Exhaust questions --> Get alignment --> Assume the close\n```\n\n---\n\n## STEP 1: SET THE FRAME (5 minutes)\n\n**Goal:** Establish authority. Lay out expectations. Plant the close early.\n\n### The Script:\n\n> \"Joseph, thanks for jumping back on. Before we dive in, let me lay out how I want to spend the next 45 minutes.\n>\n> I went deep on your business after our call yesterday. I mapped out the entire construction staffing market — who's hiring electricians, where the decision-makers are, and what it takes to get 10x the pipeline you have today. And I'll be honest — what you described is very close to a system we already built and are running for another client. LinkedIn sourcing, automated outreach, email follow-ups, the whole engine. So this isn't theoretical for us.\n>\n> Here's how this will go: I'm going to ask you a few questions to make sure I understand where you're headed. Then I'll walk you through exactly what we'd build, phase by phase, with timelines. I'll show you the numbers — real numbers, not hype. And I'll break down what it costs.\n>\n> At the end, there's really only two outcomes — either this makes sense for where you are and we get moving, or it doesn't and I'll tell you that honestly. I'm not going to waste your time or mine. Sound fair?\"\n\n### Why this works:\n- **Authority**: \"I went deep on your business\" — you did the work, you're not winging it\n- **Proof planted early**: \"We already built and are running this for another client\" — this sits in his head for the rest of the call\n- **Clear expectations**: He knows what's coming\n- **Yes/No frame planted**: \"Two outcomes — either it makes sense or it doesn't\"\n- **Respect for his time**: He's a hustler doing outreach every night. He values efficiency\n\n---\n\n## STEP 2: DISCOVERY — ROLLER COASTER METHOD (15 minutes)\n\n**Goal:** Get Joseph to sell himself on why he needs this. Future state first (where he wants to go) -> current state pain (what's holding him back). By the time you pitch, he's already emotionally committed to the outcome.\n\n### PART A: FUTURE STATE (Start here — get him excited)\n\n> \"Joseph, before I show you anything, I want to understand where you're trying to go. Forget the automation for a second.\n>\n> If we fast-forward 6 months and everything went right — what does your staffing business look like? How many contracts are you closing per month? How many electricians are you placing?\"\n\n**Let him talk. Then dig deeper:**\n\n> \"And when you say [X contracts/month] — what does that look like in revenue? Ballpark?\"\n\n> \"Is it just data center electrical, or do you want to expand into other trades? Solar? Plumbing?\"\n\n> \"Are you planning to stay solo or build a team around this?\"\n\n**What you're listening for:**\n- His revenue target (even a rough one) — use this in the pitch\n- Whether he's thinking small (\"maybe 5 contracts\") or big (\"I want to dominate this space\")\n- Expansion plans — this seeds Phase 2\n\n### PART B: CURRENT STATE PAIN (Now bring him down to reality)\n\n> \"Got it. So that's the goal. Let me ask you this — right now, doing it manually every night, how many people are you actually reaching per week?\"\n\n**He'll say something like 20-50. Then:**\n\n> \"And out of those, how many turn into actual conversations?\"\n\n> \"You mentioned on our last call that you got a contract through a referral — someone said 'wrong person, talk to X' — and that turned into a deal. How often does that happen?\"\n\n> \"So you're doing this every night, manually, after work. How long can you keep that up?\"\n\n**What you're doing:** Building the gap between where he wants to be (6 months vision) and where he is (50 manual messages a night, hoping for responses). The bigger the gap, the easier the close.\n\n**The bridge statement:**\n\n> \"So here's the gap: you want [his stated goal — e.g., 5-10 contracts/month], but right now you're manually reaching 50 people a week and closing maybe 1 per month. The math doesn't work at this pace. What if I showed you how to reach 2,000+ decision-makers every month — across LinkedIn AND email — without you doing the manual work every night?\"\n\n---\n\n## STEP 3: THREE-PILLAR PITCH (10 minutes)\n\n**Goal:** Present the solution in three clear pillars using the PFS framework (Problem → Feature → Solution). Use Joseph's exact language from the call.\n\n### The Setup:\n\n> \"Here's what we'd build for you. I'm going to break it into three parts because there are really three problems to solve.\"\n\n---\n\n### PILLAR 1: \"Find Every Decision-Maker Who Needs Electricians\"\n\n**Problem** (use his words):\n> \"You told me yesterday that you're searching LinkedIn manually — typing in 'Director of Construction, data center' — and scrolling through results. That works, but you're limited to whatever LinkedIn shows you in one session. You're also only searching one platform.\"\n\n**Feature:**\n> \"What we build is a sourcing engine. We set up LinkedIn Sales Navigator with your exact filters — title, industry, geography, company size — and we use automation tools to pull 500 to 1,000 new leads per week. Every one of them is a Project Manager, Director, VP, or Field Lead at a construction company in the US.\n>\n> Then we run every lead through an enrichment system that finds their email. Not just one tool — we run a waterfall: Apollo first, then Prospeo, then Hunter, then Dropcontact. First match wins. Instead of finding maybe 50% of emails, we find 70-85%.\n>\n> That means instead of reaching 50 people a week, you have 500-1,000 verified contacts per week ready for outreach.\"\n\n**Solution** (his desired outcome):\n> \"You told me you want new accounts. This is how you fill the top of the funnel — so you're never hunting for people to contact. They're already in your pipeline, verified, and ready to be reached.\"\n\n---\n\n### PILLAR 2: \"Reach Them From Two Directions Without Lifting a Finger\"\n\n**Problem** (use his words):\n> \"Right now you're doing this every night before bed. Connect, send a message, maybe follow up once. And you said yourself — the limit is about 100 connects a week on LinkedIn. That's a ceiling.\"\n\n**Feature:**\n> \"We set up two channels running in parallel:\n>\n> **LinkedIn:** 100 connections per week with a personalized note, automated DMs when they accept, follow-up DMs if they don't respond, and InMail for the highest-value targets who don't accept the connect.\n>\n> **Email at scale:** We set up 3 sending domains — they look like your business but are separate so your main domain is protected. 9 email accounts total, warmed up over 2 weeks, then ramping to 350-450 cold emails per day. Each lead gets a 7-touch sequence over 30 days — not just one email and hope. Seven different angles: direct pitch, short follow-up, case study, pain point, referral ask, proof, and a breakup email.\n>\n> The data shows most replies come on touches 3 through 7. Right now you're doing touch 1, maybe touch 2. You're leaving 80% of your responses on the table.\"\n\n**PROOF DROP** (this is where you show it's real — not a slide deck):\n\n> \"And Joseph — this isn't a proposal I'm reading off a page. We already built this exact system for a client. Here's what it does right now:\n>\n> It finds leads from Apollo and LinkedIn automatically. On the LinkedIn side, it sends the connection request, waits for them to accept, then sends the DM — hands-free. On the email side, it sends the first email, runs the follow-up sequence, and stops automatically the moment someone replies — no more than 3 follow-ups if there's no response, so you never spam anyone.\n>\n> The engine already exists. For your business, we customize the targeting — data center construction, those exact titles you showed me yesterday — we write the messaging in your voice, and we plug it into your HubSpot. But the system? It's built. It's running. This isn't starting from scratch.\"\n\n**[If you have any numbers from that client — response rates, leads sourced, meetings booked — add them here:]**\n\n> \"For that client, we're pulling [X leads/week] and seeing [Y% response rate / Z meetings booked]. Your market is different, but the mechanics are identical.\"\n\n**[If you don't have numbers yet, skip the above line. The \"it's built and running\" proof is strong enough on its own.]**\n\n---\n\n**Solution** (his desired outcome):\n> \"You said you want 20% response rate and 10-12% booking a meeting. With a 7-touch sequence across two channels, we're targeting 140 to 270 responses per month and 18 to 35 meetings booked. You told me yesterday that even a few contracts a month is a win — this system is designed to deliver 4 to 7.\"\n\n**Use his numbers:**\n> \"You said 10-12% meeting rate is a win. At 2,000-2,500 outreach per month, that's 200-300 responses and 20-30 meetings. Even at half that — you're at 10-15 meetings. That's already 3x what you're doing manually.\"\n\n---\n\n### PILLAR 3: \"Never Miss a Response or Referral Again\"\n\n**Problem** (use his exact story):\n> \"You told me the best story yesterday — you messaged someone, they said 'I'm the wrong person, talk to this guy,' and that referral turned into a contract. That's your highest-converting channel. But right now, tracking those referrals is manual. What happens when you're getting 100-200 responses a month instead of 10?\"\n\n**Feature:**\n> \"Everything flows into HubSpot — which you already use. But we add an intelligence layer on top:\n>\n> When someone responds, our system classifies it automatically — interested, not now, wrong person, or unsubscribe. If they say 'talk to Sarah in procurement,' the system extracts Sarah's name and company, finds her email and LinkedIn, creates a new lead tagged as a referral, and pings you on WhatsApp within minutes: 'Referral received — call Sarah Johnson at ABC Construction, she handles staffing contracts. Here's her email and LinkedIn.'\n>\n> You pick up the phone and close. That's your job. Everything before that — we handle.\"\n\n**Solution** (his desired outcome):\n> \"You told me the referral chain is how you closed your first contract. Imagine that happening 5x, 10x per month — and never missing one because it was buried in your LinkedIn inbox at 2am.\"\n\n---\n\n## STEP 4: PHASE 2 TEASE (3 minutes)\n\n**Goal:** Don't sell Phase 2 now. Plant the seed so he sees the vision — and so he knows working with you is a long-term play, not a one-time project.\n\n> \"Joseph, that's Phase 1. And I want to be straight with you — Phase 1 alone will transform your pipeline. But here's what gets me excited about Phase 2, once this is running.\n>\n> Right now we're sourcing from LinkedIn only. But do you know where your buyers actually hang out beyond LinkedIn?\"\n\n**Pause. Let him think.**\n\n> \"We've mapped 30+ platforms where construction decision-makers spend time. Job boards like Indeed, Trade Hounds, ConstructionJobs — where companies are literally posting 'Hiring electricians for data center project.' Those are the warmest leads on the planet because they're advertising that they need what you sell TODAY.\n>\n> Beyond that: industry directories like the ENR Top 400 — the 400 largest construction firms in America. The AGC with 33,000 member firms. Project bid databases like ConstructConnect where we can see who just won a $50M data center contract — and reach out before they even post a job.\n>\n> Reddit communities where PMs are complaining about labor shortages. Trade shows where every attendee is your buyer. We even found vendor matching platforms where GCs are actively looking for staffing subs.\n>\n> And in Phase 2, we don't just pitch electricians — we expand to plumbers, HVAC, and other skilled trades. Same system, broader market.\n>\n> But that's down the road. Phase 1 first. Prove the machine, then scale it.\"\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Shows you've done massive research (authority)\n- Creates a vision of what's possible (future state)\n- But doesn't overwhelm — \"Phase 1 first\" keeps it focused\n- Makes him feel like he's getting the long-term partner, not a one-time vendor\n\n---\n\n## STEP 5: PRICING & TIMELINE (5 minutes)\n\n**Goal:** Value stack first. Then drop the price. Then silence.\n\n### Timeline First (Build Urgency):\n\n> \"Let me walk you through the timeline because I know you want to start seeing results fast.\n>\n> **Week 1:** We set up everything — your sending domains, email accounts, Sales Navigator connection, enrichment tools, HubSpot pipeline. We start warming up the email accounts immediately. This runs on autopilot for 14 days.\n>\n> **Week 2:** While emails are warming up, we build your lead lists and outreach sequences. The 7-touch email funnel, your LinkedIn messages, the response handling workflows. We also pull your first batch of 500-1,000 leads.\n>\n> **Week 3:** LinkedIn outreach goes live — 20 connections per day. Email starts at low volume — 10-15 per account per day. You start seeing responses.\n>\n> **Week 4:** Email ramps to full volume. LinkedIn at full speed. Job board monitoring live. The machine is running.\n>\n> By the end of month 1, you're reaching 2,000+ people. By month 2, you should be booking 15-30 meetings per month. You told me you want new accounts — this is the engine that delivers them.\"\n\n### Value Stack (Before Price):\n\n> \"So for everything included — here's what you're getting:\n>\n> - Complete infrastructure: 3 domains, 9 email accounts, all warmed up and configured\n> - LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration with automated sourcing\n> - Email enrichment that finds 70-85% of contacts (not the 50% you'd get on your own)\n> - 7-touch email sequence professionally written and loaded\n> - LinkedIn outreach: automated connects, DMs, follow-ups\n> - Response classification — interested, referral, not now — all handled automatically\n> - Referral detection that finds the new contact and pings you on WhatsApp\n> - HubSpot pipeline fully configured\n> - Weekly reporting so you know exactly what's working\"\n\n### The Tool Costs (Separate First — Anchor Low):\n\n> \"First, the tools. These are third-party subscriptions you'd own directly — regardless of which option you go with:\n>\n> - LinkedIn Sales Navigator: ~$100/month\n> - Phantombuster: ~$69/month\n> - Clay: ~$149/month\n> - Instantly.ai: ~$30/month\n> - Email accounts: ~$54/month\n> - Domains: ~$3/month\n> - Email verification: ~$30/month\n> - N8N hosting: ~$20/month\n>\n> Total tool cost: roughly $455 to $505 per month. You own all of it. Even if you stop working with us tomorrow, you keep the entire infrastructure.\"\n\n### Two Options (Present Both — Let Him Choose):\n\n> \"Now for our side, I want to give you two options. Because I know you said you want to prove this out, and I want to respect that.\"\n\n**Option 1 — Present first (the anchor):**\n\n> \"**Option 1: We build the entire system and hand it to you. One-time fee: $3,500.**\n>\n> That includes everything I just walked you through — the full infrastructure setup, the lead sourcing automation, the email sequences, the LinkedIn outreach workflows, the response handling, the HubSpot pipeline. We build it, we test it, we train you on how to run it, and we give you 2 weeks of support after handoff.\n>\n> After that, you run the machine yourself. You'd log into the tools, pull your lead lists, monitor responses, adjust sequences. It works — but it means you're spending time operating the system each week instead of just closing deals.\"\n\n**Option 2 — Present second (the recommended):**\n\n> \"**Option 2: We build it AND we run it for you. $1,500 per month, 6-month commitment.**\n>\n> Same full build — but we don't hand it off. We manage the lead sourcing every week. We run your LinkedIn outreach. We manage your email sequences. We handle response classification. When a referral comes in, we find the contact and ping you. You get a weekly report showing exactly what's working.\n>\n> Your only job is picking up the phone when we send you a hot lead and closing the deal. That's it.\n>\n> The 6-month commitment is because the system needs runway — email warm-up alone takes 3-4 weeks, and we don't hit full volume until month 2. Anything shorter doesn't give the machine enough time to prove itself.\"\n\n**[SILENCE. Let him process. Do not fill the gap.]**\n\n### The Comparison (Only If He Asks or Hesitates):\n\n> \"Let me put it this way:\n>\n> | | Option 1: One-Time Build | Option 2: Managed (Recommended) |\n> |---|---|---|\n> | **Our fee** | $3,500 (once) | $1,500/month (6-month min = $9,000) |\n> | **Tool costs** | ~$500/month (you pay either way) | ~$500/month (you pay either way) |\n> | **Total cost, 6 months** | $3,500 + $3,000 tools = **$6,500** | $9,000 + $3,000 tools = **$12,000** |\n> | **Who runs the system** | You — every week | Us — you just close deals |\n> | **Your time commitment** | 5-10 hours/week operating the machine | 0 hours — we send you leads, you take meetings |\n> | **What happens if something breaks** | You troubleshoot | We fix it |\n> | **Ongoing optimization** | You figure it out | We A/B test sequences, adjust targeting, improve weekly |\n>\n> The question is really: do you want to spend 5-10 hours a week running the system, or do you want to spend that time closing contracts?\"\n\n### The ROI Math (Use For Either Option):\n\n> \"Joseph, your staffing contracts are $10,000 to $50,000 each. With Option 1, one single contract pays for the entire build plus a year of tools. With Option 2, one contract per month covers the entire system 5 to 25 times over. You closed one contract from manual outreach doing 50 messages a night. This system does 2,500 per month. The ROI math isn't even close.\"\n\n---\n\n## STEP 6: CLOSE (5 minutes)\n\n### 6A: Exhaust All Questions\n\n> \"What questions do you have about either option?\"\n\n**Answer every single question. Do not rush. Do not re-pitch. Let him ask until he says \"I think I'm good\" or \"No more questions.\"**\n\n### 6B: Get Alignment\n\n> \"Cool. Let me ask you this — based on everything we just walked through, do you feel like this system would get you to those [X contracts/month] you mentioned?\"\n\n**You need a clear YES. If he gives a wishy-washy \"I think so\" — dig in:**\n\n> \"What part are you unsure about? Let me address that.\"\n\n### 6C: Yes or No Frame\n\n> \"Joseph, I know there's usually three things someone can say at this point — yes let's do it, no it's not for me, or 'let me think about it.' And I want you to know I'm completely fine with a no. The one I want to avoid is the 'let me think about it' — because in my experience that usually just means there's a question I didn't answer. So can we keep it to a yes or a no?\"\n\n### 6D: Assume the Close\n\n**If he picks Option 2 (managed — this is the goal):**\n\n> \"Smart move. Next steps are simple — I'll send you the agreement today. Once that's signed, we start setting up your domains and infrastructure tomorrow. You'll be live within 3-4 weeks, and you don't have to touch anything except your phone when meetings start coming in. Sound good?\"\n\n**If he picks Option 1 (one-time build):**\n\n> \"Done. I'll send the agreement today. Once signed, we start building immediately. We'll have you fully set up and trained within 3-4 weeks. And if down the road you want us to take over management so you can focus purely on closing — that option's always there.\"\n\n**(Seed the retainer upgrade — many one-time build clients upgrade within 2-3 months when they realize running the machine is work.)**\n\n**If he says he needs to think about it (despite the frame):**\n\n> \"No problem. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the investment, the approach, or which option to go with? Let's talk through it now so you have everything you need to make a decision.\"\n\n**If it's specifically about Option 1 vs Option 2:**\n\n> \"Tell you what — if you're torn between the two, go with Option 1. Lower commitment, you get the full system, and if you decide later that you'd rather have us manage it, we can switch to the retainer model anytime. Fair?\"\n\n**(This is the 'downsell to save the deal' play. A $3,500 close today is better than a 'let me think about it' that turns into ghosting. And once he's in, the upgrade to managed is natural.)**\n\n**If he says no:**\n\n> \"Totally respect that. Can I ask what the main concern is? Just so I know for my own learning.\"\n\n---\n\n## OBJECTION HANDLING\n\n### \"It's too expensive / I need to keep costs low\"\n\n> \"I hear you — you mentioned cost is important as you prove this out. That's exactly why I gave you two options. Option 1 is $3,500 one time — one single contract pays for the entire system plus a year of tools. You're doing 50 messages a night manually right now. If your time is worth even $50/hour, you're already spending $1,500+ a month in sweat equity. This replaces that AND reaches 50x more people. The question isn't whether you can afford it — it's whether you can afford to keep doing 50 messages a night for the next 6 months.\"\n\n### \"I want to start small / just test it\"\n\n> \"That's exactly what this is. Phase 1 is the test — LinkedIn sourcing only, 3 email domains, prove the numbers work. And if you want the smallest commitment possible, Option 1 is a one-time $3,500 build. You own everything. If the numbers work, we scale to Phase 2 together. If they don't, you still have the entire infrastructure. I'm not asking you to commit to the full vision today — just Phase 1.\"\n\n### \"I talked to someone on Upwork who can do it cheaper\"\n\n> \"For sure — there are people who'll set up a Phantombuster script for $200. But here's the difference: we already have this system built and running for a client right now. LinkedIn sourcing, automated connects, DMs, email follow-ups that stop on reply — it's live, not a promise. On top of that, the Upwork guy isn't building you the multi-domain email infrastructure, the 7-touch sequence strategy, the response classification, the referral detection, the HubSpot integration, or the ongoing optimization. You can buy the plumbing cheap. What you're paying for with us is a proven engine that's already generating results — customized for your market.\"\n\n### \"Can I just buy the tools and do it myself?\"\n\n> \"Absolutely. I can hand you the tool list right now. But here's the reality — we've already built this system, debugged it, and have it running live. You'd be spending the next 2-3 months figuring out Phantombuster, Clay, Instantly, and N8N on your own. Meanwhile, you're still doing 50 messages a night. Or — we plug you into a system that's already proven, and you're booking meetings in 3 weeks. Which gets you to new accounts faster?\"\n\n---\n\n## POST-CALL ACTIONS\n\n**If he closes:**\n1. Send agreement within 2 hours\n2. Send \"Welcome\" email with Week 1 checklist (what he needs to provide: domain preferences, LinkedIn credentials, HubSpot access, pitch messaging)\n3. Buy domains same day and start warm-up\n\n**If he asks for time:**\n1. Send a follow-up email within 1 hour summarizing the three pillars and the numbers\n2. Include a one-page comparison: \"Manual vs. System\" showing his current metrics vs. projected\n3. Set a specific follow-up time: \"I'll ping you tomorrow at [time] — does that work?\"\n4. Do NOT send the full strategy document — that's your leverage\n\n**If he says no:**\n1. Thank him\n2. Offer to reconnect in 30 days: \"If you change your mind or want to revisit, I'm here\"\n3. Move on — every hour on a \"no\" is an hour not spent on a \"yes\"\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL REMINDERS\n\n1. **Do NOT lead with tools or features.** Lead with HIS goals, HIS numbers, HIS words from the first call. The tools are how — he's buying the what (contracts, revenue, pipeline).\n\n2. **Use his exact language.** He said \"new accounts,\" \"response rate,\" \"prove it out,\" \"automate.\" Mirror these back.\n\n3. **The referral story is your anchor.** He told you the most powerful case study himself — someone said \"wrong person, talk to X\" and it turned into a contract. Use this story 2-3 times during the pitch. It's HIS proof that the system works.\n\n4. **Don't over-explain the tech.** He doesn't care about Phantombuster vs. Heyreach. He cares about: how many people will I reach, how many will respond, and how fast can it start.\n\n5. **He's comparing you to a $200 Upwork freelancer.** Your job is to make that comparison feel absurd by the end of the call. Not by trashing the freelancer — by showing the depth of what you've already built and have running live.\n\n6. **Cost sensitivity is real but solvable.** He's solo, bootstrapping. But he also knows one contract is $10K-$50K. Frame every cost against that number.\n\n7. **Phase 2 is the retention play.** Even if he doesn't care about it today, planting the seed means he sees you as a long-term partner, not a one-time vendor. That changes how he evaluates the price.\n\n8. **\"We already built this\" is your killer line.** You mention it three times: once in the frame (\"this isn't theoretical\"), once in Pillar 2 (the full proof drop with specifics), and once in objection handling (vs. Upwork / DIY). Three touches — plants it, proves it, reinforces it. Don't overuse it beyond that or it sounds desperate.\n","size":"27.1 KB","path":"Joseph/04_sales_script.md"},{"filename":"06_proposal.md","title":"Proposal","content":"# SERVICE PROPOSAL\n\n**Lead Generation & Outreach Automation**\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** Small Group\n**Prepared for:** Joseph Cyriac\n**Date:** February 13, 2026\n**Proposal valid until:** February 19, 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. OVERVIEW\n\nThis proposal outlines the scope, deliverables, timeline, and investment for a fully managed lead generation and outreach automation system — designed specifically for Joseph Cyriac's construction staffing business.\n\nSmall Group will build, deploy, and continuously manage an automated pipeline that sources qualified decision-makers in the data center construction space and reaches them through LinkedIn and email — so Joseph can focus entirely on closing deals.\n\n---\n\n## 2. OBJECTIVES\n\n- Replace manual LinkedIn outreach with an automated multi-channel system\n- Source 500–1,000 verified leads per week from the data center construction industry\n- Run LinkedIn + email outreach in parallel with multi-touch sequences\n- Automatically classify and route responses to streamline follow-up\n- Configure HubSpot as the central pipeline for all lead activity\n- Continuously iterate on targeting, messaging, and funneling strategies to improve conversion rates\n\n---\n\n## 3. SCOPE OF WORK\n\n### Month 1 — System Build & Launch\n\n#### 3.1 Lead Sourcing Engine\n\n- Configure LinkedIn Sales Navigator with precision filters (titles, industries, geographies, company size) targeting Project Managers, Directors, VPs, and Field Leads at data center construction companies across the US\n- Set up automated lead extraction to pull 500–1,000 new contacts per week\n- Build an email enrichment waterfall (multi-provider verification) to achieve 70–85% email match rate on sourced leads\n- Establish deduplication and list hygiene processes to maintain data quality\n\n#### 3.2 Email Outreach Infrastructure\n\n- Procure and configure 3 dedicated sending domains (separate from the client's primary domain to protect sender reputation)\n- Set up 9 email accounts across those domains\n- Execute a 2–3 week email warm-up and ramp-up process\n- Ramp to 350–450 cold emails per day at full volume\n\n#### 3.3 Email Sequences\n\n- Write and deploy a 7-touch email sequence over 30 days per lead, including:\n  - Direct pitch\n  - Short follow-up\n  - Case study / proof angle\n  - Pain point angle\n  - Referral ask\n  - Social proof\n  - Breakup email\n- Configure auto-stop on reply — sequences halt the moment a prospect responds\n\n#### 3.4 LinkedIn Outreach Automation\n\n- Automate 100 connection requests per week with personalized notes\n- Set up automated DMs triggered on connection acceptance\n- Configure follow-up DMs for non-responders\n- Set up InMail sequences for high-value targets who don't accept connection requests\n\n#### 3.5 Response Handling\n\n- Build an automated response classification system:\n  - **Interested** — flagged for immediate follow-up\n  - **Not Right Now** — tagged and queued for future re-engagement\n  - **Wrong Person** — logged with any referral information\n  - **Unsubscribe** — removed from all sequences automatically\n- Route classified responses into HubSpot with appropriate tags and pipeline stages\n\n#### 3.6 HubSpot Pipeline Configuration\n\n- Configure deal stages aligned to the outreach funnel (New Lead → Contacted → Responded → Meeting Booked → Contract)\n- Set up contact properties, tags, and views for managing inbound responses\n- Integrate outreach data so all lead activity is visible in one place\n\n---\n\n### Month 2 Onward — Iteration & Expansion\n\nStarting from the second month, the focus shifts to:\n\n1. **Strategy Iteration**\n   - A/B test email sequences (subject lines, copy, send times, follow-up cadence)\n   - A/B test LinkedIn messaging (connection notes, DM copy, InMail scripts)\n   - Adjust targeting criteria based on response data (refine titles, industries, company sizes)\n   - Analyze conversion metrics at each funnel stage and optimize for drop-off points\n\n2. **Additional System Development (Phase 2 Scoping)**\n   - Explore and build sourcing from additional platforms beyond LinkedIn (job boards, industry directories, bid databases)\n   - Expand targeting to adjacent trades (plumbing, HVAC, other skilled trades) as opportunity arises\n   - Build new automation workflows based on learnings from Phase 1\n\n3. **Ongoing Management**\n   - Weekly lead sourcing managed by Small Group\n   - LinkedIn + email outreach operated and monitored by Small Group\n   - Response classification and routing maintained by Small Group\n   - Weekly performance reports delivered to the client\n\n---\n\n## 4.

They analyze a client's target audience, operations, and goals to develop tailored systems for automating content creation, social media engagement, and lead generation.\n\nAutomating Content for Stocks App @ 1:01\n\nErnest Chuang described his company's investing research app that tracks insider stock trades. He is looking to automate the process of generating articles about these trades and distributing them across social media and forums to drive more app downloads. This would involve using AI to extract data from filings, generate article content, and post it through a network of accounts.\n\nDefining the Target Audience @ 4:23\n\nPrakarsh and Ernest discussed that the target audience for the app is male investors, likely in the 22-35 age range, who are interested in stock trading insights and research.\n\nDeveloping the Content and Engagement Strategy @ 6:37\n\nThey outlined a two-pronged approach: 1) Automating the creation of blog posts and social media content about insider stock trades, with the ability to pull data and images directly from filings, and 2) Implementing a system to automatically comment, interact, and drive engagement on relevant social media posts and forums.\n\nSetting Growth Targets @ 24:16\n\nPrakarsh and Ernest agreed to aim for 10-20,000 app downloads over the next 2 months through the organic content and engagement strategy, with the goal of eventually replacing paid marketing entirely with this approach.\n\nNext Steps @ 27:02\n\nPrakarsh proposed having an additional call with his team to review the details provided and develop a more comprehensive strategy. They will also share examples of previous work to demonstrate their capabilities. The plan is to finalize the approach and begin implementation as soon as possible, potentially starting as early as next week.\n","size":"2.1 KB","path":"Ernest/01_discovery_call_transcript.md"},{"filename":"02_sales_script.md","title":"Sales Script","content":"# SALES CALL SCRIPT — Ernest Chuang (Follow-Up Call)\n\n**Date:** February 17, 2026\n**Call Type:** Follow-up strategy presentation\n**First Call:** February 11, 2026\n**Goal:** Present the 5-pillar strategy, walk through pricing, close or schedule next step\n\n---\n\n## PRE-CALL CHECKLIST\n\n- [ ] Pitch deck open and ready to screen share (Ernest_pitch_deck.html)\n- [ ] Proposal document ready to send (Ernest_proposal.md)\n- [ ] First call transcript reviewed (key details fresh in mind)\n- [ ] Know Ernest's name, app details, and what he asked for\n- [ ] Quiet environment, camera on, good audio\n- [ ] CRM/notes open to capture anything new Ernest shares\n\n---\n\n## OPENING (2-3 minutes)\n\n**Build rapport, set the agenda, confirm goals.**\n\n> \"Hey Ernest, good to see you again. Thanks for making the time — I know you're busy building the app, so I want to make sure this is valuable for you.\"\n\n> \"So last time we talked, you walked me through the app, what you're looking to do with content, and your download goals. Since then, my team and I went deep on this — we put together a full strategy that I'm excited to walk you through.\"\n\n> \"Here's what I want to cover today: First, I'll recap what I heard from you to make sure I didn't miss anything. Then I'll walk you through the five-part system we've designed — content generation, SEO, social distribution, engagement, and a growth hack that I think you're going to love. Then we'll talk numbers and next steps. Sound good?\"\n\n**Wait for confirmation. If he wants to add something, let him.**\n\n> \"Before I dive in — has anything changed since we last spoke? Any new priorities or things I should know about?\"\n\n---\n\n## RECAP & VALIDATION (3-5 minutes)\n\n**Show him you listened. Make him feel heard.**\n\n> \"So here's what I took away from our first conversation. You've built this investing research app that tracks insider stock trades — when insiders buy or sell, your app picks that up. The data's there, but right now you're not turning that data into content at scale.\"\n\n> \"What you want is an automated system that takes that trade data and generates articles about it — blog posts, social media posts, forum posts — and distributes them everywhere your target audience hangs out. Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, investing forums.\"\n\n> \"And not just posting — you also want engagement. Commenting on relevant threads, participating in conversations, making it look organic so people naturally discover your app.\"\n\n> \"The end goal: 10 to 20 thousand downloads in the next couple months, and eventually replace paid marketing entirely with this organic engine.\"\n\n> \"Your audience is male investors, roughly 22 to 35, who are actively looking for stock trading insights.\"\n\n> \"Did I miss anything? Anything you'd add or change?\"\n\n**Let him respond. Take notes on anything new. Then transition:**\n\n> \"Perfect. So based on all of that, here's what we put together...\"\n\n---\n\n## THE STRATEGY PRESENTATION (10-15 minutes)\n\n### Pillar 1: Content Engine\n\n> \"The foundation of everything is content. Your app already generates the data — insider trades, who's buying, who's selling, what companies. That's gold. The problem is turning that into content fast enough to matter.\"\n\n> \"What we build is an AI content pipeline. Your app feeds us the trade data, and our system automatically generates publish-ready articles. We're talking 20 to 30 articles a week. Each one covers a specific insider trade — what happened, why it matters, what it could mean for the stock.\"\n\n> \"We set up templates, we dial in the tone so it sounds like your brand, and we establish a quality process. You approve the style once, and then it runs.\"\n\n> \"Think about it — right now, how many articles are you publishing a week about insider trades?\"\n\n**Let him answer. Likely very few or zero. Then:**\n\n> \"Right. So we're going from that to 20-30 a week. That's a massive content advantage over anyone else in this space.\"\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 2: SEO & Blog\n\n> \"All that content needs a home, and it needs to be findable. That's where SEO comes in.\"\n\n> \"When someone Googles 'insider stock trades today' or 'SEC insider trading filings' or even a specific company like 'Apple insider trading' — we want your blog showing up. Every article we generate is optimized for search: the right keywords, the right structure, meta descriptions, the whole thing.\"\n\n> \"Here's why this matters long-term: once an article ranks on Google, it keeps driving traffic forever. It's not like an ad where you stop paying and the traffic stops. This content compounds. Month 1 you have 80 articles working for you. Month 6 you have 500+. Each one is a door into your app.\"\n\n> \"70% of marketers say SEO outperforms paid ads for driving sales. And for your niche — insider trading insights — there's real search demand and not a lot of competition. That's the sweet spot.\"\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 3: Social Distribution\n\n> \"So we're generating content and it's ranking on Google. But we're not waiting for people to find it — we're also pushing it out everywhere your audience already spends time.\"\n\n> \"Reddit — subreddits like r/stocks, r/investing, r/wallstreetbets. Twitter/X — the financial community there is massive. StockTwits — that's literally built for this. Investing forums. We're posting across all of them.\"\n\n> \"And here's the key — we're not posting from one branded account. We set up a network of accounts across each platform. Different posting styles, different voices. It looks organic because it is organic-style distribution. When five different accounts are talking about the same insider trade your app tracks, that creates buzz.\"\n\n> \"Your audience — 22 to 35 year old male investors — they're on Reddit and Twitter daily. That's where they discover things. We meet them there.\"\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 4: Engagement Automation\n\n> \"Posting is half the equation. The other half is participation. We don't just post and walk away — we engage.\"\n\n> \"Our system monitors trending stock discussions and insider trading threads. When a relevant conversation is happening, we automatically drop contextual comments from the account network. Not spammy stuff — actual value-add comments about the insider trade data your app tracks.\"\n\n> \"Why does this work? Because a comment on a popular post gets seen by thousands of people. It's a micro-touchpoint. Someone reads a helpful comment about an insider trade, checks the profile, finds a link to your app. That's how organic discovery works.\"\n\n> \"And it compounds. As these accounts build reputation in the communities — karma on Reddit, followers on Twitter — their comments get more visibility. It's a flywheel.\"\n\n---\n\n### Pillar 5: App Download Accelerator\n\n**This is the big one. Lean in here.**\n\n> \"OK so everything I've covered so far is the organic engine — content, SEO, social, engagement. That's the long game. But I know you also want downloads fast. So let me share something that I think is going to be a game-changer for you.\"\n\n> \"We have a growth strategy that drove 106,000 downloads for an app — at zero ad spend.\"\n\n**Pause. Let that land.**\n\n> \"Let me walk you through it. There's a developer who had an AI app. He was doing maybe a few hundred downloads a month. We helped him execute a specific strategy...\"\n\n---\n\n## THE CASE STUDY (3-5 minutes)\n\n> \"Here's what we did. Three steps.\"\n\n> \"First — ASO. We optimized his app store listing. Keywords, description, screenshots. Made sure when people searched related terms, his app actually showed up.\"\n\n> \"Second — we added a ratings prompt at the right moment in the user experience. This is important because ratings and reviews directly affect how the App Store ranks you.\"\n\n> \"Third — and this is the hack — we created a lifetime offer in the app. A premium feature that normally costs money. We made it free for two days. Then we submitted it to AppAdvice — which is a site that features apps that have gone free. It's like a deal site for apps.\"\n\n> \"The result: 106,000 downloads in that window. And here's the real kicker — the download spike boosted his keyword rankings so much that his organic downloads kept growing after. What started as a single campaign became a sustainable growth engine for the business.\"\n\n> \"Now imagine that for your app. You already have real, unique data. Insider trading insights aren't commoditized — most apps don't have what you have. If we run this same playbook alongside the content engine, we're attacking downloads from two directions: the organic content flywheel AND a concentrated download spike that boosts your rankings.\"\n\n> \"That's how we hit 10 to 20K downloads in two months. And the beauty is — the content keeps compounding after. Month 3, Month 4, Month 6 — it only gets bigger.\"\n\n---\n\n## PRICING PRESENTATION (5 minutes)\n\n**Transition from value to investment.**\n\n> \"So that's the full system — five pillars working together. Content generation, SEO, social distribution, engagement, and the download accelerator. Let me talk about what it takes to get this running.\"\n\n> \"There are two ways to work with us.\"\n\n### Option 1 — One-Time Build\n\n> \"Option one is a one-time build. We design and build the entire system — the content pipeline, the social infrastructure, the engagement automation, the ASO optimization — and then we hand it off to you. You run it. That's $7,500 one-time, and it includes two weeks of support after handoff.\"\n\n> \"The tradeoff is — you'd need to dedicate about 10 to 15 hours a week to operate it. Managing the content output, monitoring the social accounts, tweaking the engagement. And there's no ongoing optimization from us, so if something needs adjusting, that's on you.\"\n\n### Option 2 — Fully Managed (Recommend this)\n\n> \"Option two — and this is what I'd recommend — is fully managed. We build everything AND we run it for you. Every week, my team is generating the content, posting across all platforms, managing the engagement, running the growth campaigns, and optimizing based on what's working.\"\n\n> \"That's $2,500 a month, 6-month commitment. You'd also have about $300 to $350 a month in tool costs — the AI APIs, scheduling tools, SEO tools — but those are in your name, so you own everything.\"\n\n### The ROI Frame\n\n> \"Let me put it this way. At $2,500 a month, if we hit even the low end of 10,000 downloads in two months, that's $0.25 per download. Compare that to what paid ads cost for app installs — you're probably looking at $2 to $5 per download on paid channels. We're 10x to 20x more efficient.\"\n\n> \"And here's the real difference — paid ads stop the moment you stop paying. The content we build, the SEO rankings, the social presence — that keeps working for you forever. You're building an asset, not renting traffic.\"\n\n> \"One more thing — the fully managed option means minimal time from you. You provide API access and approve the content style upfront, and then we handle the day-to-day. You focus on the product, we focus on growth.\"\n\n---\n\n## HANDLING OBJECTIONS\n\n### \"That's expensive\"\n\n> \"I hear you. Let me put it in context though — at $2,500 a month, you're getting 15+ hours a week of dedicated team time. Content generation, social management, engagement, strategy. If you hired someone to do even half of that, you're looking at way more than $2,500 a month. And you'd still need to train them, manage them, and hope they can actually build the systems.\"\n\n> \"Plus, compare it to paid ads. To get 10,000 downloads through paid channels, you'd spend $20K to $50K. We're targeting the same result at a fraction of that cost, and the traffic doesn't disappear when you stop.\"\n\n### \"Can you guarantee results?\"\n\n> \"I can't guarantee specific numbers — no one honestly can. What I can guarantee is the system, the effort, and the continuous optimization. The case study I showed you is real — 106K downloads. The content and SEO strategies are proven across multiple industries. And because we're managing it month over month, we're constantly adjusting based on what the data tells us. If something's not working, we change it.\"\n\n### \"I need to think about it\"\n\n> \"Totally fair. I'll send you the full proposal and the pitch deck right after this call so you have everything in front of you. Here's what I'd keep in mind though — every day without content going out is organic traffic you're leaving on the table. Your competitors in the insider trading space are going to figure this out eventually. Right now, the window is wide open because so few people are doing this well.\"\n\n> \"When would be a good time to reconnect — would Thursday or Friday work?\"\n\n### \"Can we start smaller?\"\n\n> \"That's exactly what Option 1 is designed for. $7,500 one-time, we build the whole system, and you run it. It's a lower commitment upfront. The tradeoff is you're investing your own time to operate it — about 10 to 15 hours a week — and you won't have our team continuously optimizing. But it's a real option if you want to test the waters.\"\n\n### \"How do I know the content will be good?\"\n\n> \"Great question. Before we go live with anything, we create sample articles from your actual data. You review them, give feedback on tone and style, and we adjust until you're happy. Nothing goes out without your sign-off on the quality standard. Once we lock in the template and tone, the AI maintains it consistently at scale.\"\n\n### \"What if accounts get banned on these platforms?\"\n\n> \"That's something we actively manage. We don't do anything spammy — the accounts build genuine reputation over time by posting real value, not just links. We rotate posting patterns, keep volume within normal ranges, and each account has its own identity and posting style. We've operated these systems before and know the thresholds. That said, if an account does get flagged, we have replacement infrastructure ready to go. That's part of what the managed service covers — we handle the operational risk so you don't have to think about it.\"\n\n---\n\n## CLOSING (3-5 minutes)\n\n> \"So to recap — we're building you a five-part system. Your app's trade data gets turned into 20-30 articles a week, distributed across Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, and forums, with automated engagement driving traffic back to your app. On top of that, we run the AppAdvice growth hack to spike your downloads and boost your App Store rankings.\"\n\n> \"The goal is 10 to 20K downloads in two months, and building an organic channel that replaces paid marketing long-term.\"\n\n**Ask for the close:**\n\n> \"Which option makes more sense for where you're at right now — the one-time build or the fully managed?\"\n\n**If he says fully managed:**\n\n> \"Great. I'll send the agreement over today. Once you sign, we can start infrastructure setup this week — content pipeline, social accounts, ASO audit. We'll be live within four weeks.\"\n\n**If he says one-time build:**\n\n> \"Makes sense. I'll get the agreement to you today. Same timeline — we build everything out over four weeks, do a full handoff with training, and you've got two weeks of support after that.\"\n\n**If he needs time:**\n\n> \"Totally understand. I'll send you the full proposal and the deck right after this call — take a look, run the numbers, and let's reconnect. Would Thursday or Friday work better for a quick follow-up?\"\n\n**Either way, close with:**\n\n> \"I'm genuinely excited about this, Ernest. Your app has real, unique data that nobody else is turning into content at scale. That's a massive competitive advantage.

But in terms of paid media, so SEO part, I don't think we can do anything more apart from this.  It's pretty much keyword research, and I feel it's like a one time thing. So I'm not going to stress about it a lot.  So there are other verticals where I want to get into AI agent, especially paid media, wanted to check if you guys have ever done any project in with ads, regards to Google ads, meta ads, anything on those lines, in terms of creating, what exactly are we looking for that?\n\n0:44 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So are we looking to create these ads? we looking to handle the post engagement after these ads? What are we exactly looking for?\n\n0:52 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  So once the ads are set up, suppose if in a span of six months, we have ran. 25 different ads for the same objective test, which is working, which is not working, but could be it since right now human is monitoring it, they might not analyze correctly.  For example, creative would be wrong. For example, budget was not enough. That is why the campaign must have not run.  So able to optimize and tell us like, hey, this campaign, do this sort of changes and, you know, it'll be performing well and creatives are bad.  So competitors are doing this sort of creative. So you can do these creatives and it'll help out. So anything on that space, can we venture out paid media?  I want definitely some AI progress to happen, but how, what I'm very clueless. So I wanted to check on that.  My second requirement would be we want to create a lead gen funnel. Our goal is to, on a monthly basis, reach out 20,000 potential business folks at two, be shown to 20,000 folks.  And from that, at least probably 100.-realization. Let's ready. So, Let's Let's We might get 100 call bookings. Out of 100, maybe 5 we might onboard the client.  So that is keeping the conversion rates very low at this point. This is the calculation we could come up.  So want to have a lead gen. I do know webinar is one good way to go about for the lead gen and then doing the email and SMS.  But any other suggestions on lead gen? Have you guys ever built lead gen for agency? Is that some automation we can bring?  or create? That is my second question. My third question is, as I've informed you, we are working with FEC industry, that is family entertaining centers.  And within that, we are working for an indoor playground as a huge big scale. Right now they have like 10 franchises and everything is being handled by us, except one or two locations.  But most of the locations, 95% of the locations is being handled by us. So... So... For them in that industry, when it comes to social media, giving immediate updates is very important.  For example, if there is no immediately a creative needs to be created, a pop-up needs to go on the website, and then they have to come down after 24 hours.  But someone, if someone forgets to remove them or anything, you know, they will lose the business for one day because people will open the website, they'll see it's closed today, and then they won't turn up.  So that's a very, very, it looks like a small update, but then it's very, I mean, it affects the cost for the customer in a huge way.  So is there something we can do some automation where things will come out of 24 hours automatically, or if I put a duration like 5pm this time, it has to come down, where the website pop-up will go down, at least for the websites, because Instagram, it's still doable for, I mean, the client has access, so he can delete it.  But for the website, it gets a little hard, and I cannot go into every 10 clients and do this and check this and stuff.  So these are the. Three things I had, like my problem statements at the moment, these three are, and want to pick your brain and see if it is there anywhere we can collaborate on these three items.\n\n4:11 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, before we move forward, I just want to have a few questions with you about your business. So last time what I remember is I think you're handling more of the digital end of a few businesses, social media end of the few businesses.\n\n4:24 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yeah. Right.\n\n4:26 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  If you could just walk me through what you are doing and what is your target audience?\n\n4:32 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yeah, we take care of a typical digital marketing agency and we want to be AI powered. We want to be industry leaders in two niches.  One is FEC family entertaining center niche, which will come into a playground, retreats, trampoline parks, resorts, anything family entertaining, bowling avenues, stuff like that.  Number two, health and wellness. He just very many six years ago. SMS marketing, so yeah, these are all the things that we are covering in, we are in service space, not D2C yet, so that is how things are looking at the moment, and we don't have a CRM, we want to get a CRM where we can, we were considering go high level, but we were going back and front in the CRM, but that is something futuristically we want to get into that, where it is much more cleaner, sophisticated, but yeah, that's still on.\n\n6:30 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  back of our pipeline, so did I answer your question, did I send you out, yeah, think, I think I have a good idea now, and about, I think, I remember about FEC that, you you were I think engaging with them when we last spoke as well, yeah, hyperkits, indoor playground, that was a main line, hyperkits, yeah, yeah, from now, we scaled up very heavily with with the.\n\n7:00 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  In that world of hyperkits, there were just three branches were taking care. Now we're taking eight client, 10 clients right now.  There are five more clients who have already signed a deal with us. So right now we're trying to scale up and match their workforce and handle the entire operations.  And we got into health and wellness. We've already logged in one client. Now we're getting, we're going in a slower pace because team used to be stronger.  Otherwise, the entire foundation will fall down. we are focusing on hiring right now. So once the hiring part by March, we'll be finishing all the hiring part.  So that is when we want to get into lead gen and everything. I'm again, setting the pace for the April month, March end, April month.  Of course.\n\n7:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  And yeah, now that you know about, now that I know about you, let me just introduce myself again. I know that you've spoken before, but what we have been essentially targeting is how we're able to help different business owners to scale their own revenue.  you. Thank Of course, we built AI Automation, AI Agents, but everything is in the focus of how can I help your business make more money.  Because in order to make you more money, that's where I can make more money. That's the very clear instruction that I have actually developed for the business, that this is how we want to position ourselves.  So just putting that in as a thought, I just want to talk about how much revenue are you doing right now and how much you're ready to invest in your business?\n\n8:33 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  We are making up until $10k per month. And investment wise, again, budget of $2k $3k is what we have in mind, like for a one-time setup, not a recurring cost.  But yeah, that's about it. Okay.\n\n8:56 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah. Yeah. The reason I'm asking you is because when we had no Putting these numbers down, when we start working together, my goal is going to be how can I increase this number for you, because that's only when that's this is the only number that you're going to see that, you know, I worked with Prakarsh, and I went from 10k to probably 25k or 35k.  And this is the result that I was able to get. Perfect. Now, just coming back to the questions that you originally had that have you worked with lead generation automations or competitor analysis automations?  Frankly, yes, we have actually worked with that. We've worked with different businesses, like, you know, recruitment agencies. We've also worked with HVAC service owners.  So and a lot of content creators, I've actually partnered with, whom have brought me different other connections that they wanted for lead generation for digital marketing, because a lot of people were more inclined towards the agents rather than, you know, basically, they wanted these blog writing automations or anything that can help them get their SEO done, rather than having hiring someone else.  They were very much inclined towards it.\n\n10:02 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  So I have worked for the past one year. I've been working in all these spaces.\n\n10:06 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So talk about lead generation, competitor analysis, as well as voice agentic space and other agents. We've definitely worked on it.  But to identify the right system for you, I would like to know what is the manual system that you're doing for your own business, if you're talking about lead generation.  And when you talk about competitor analysis, how we are doing it right now? Is it only the meta ad library that we're using or are we doing something else?  What are the key steps so that I just have a quick understanding of what is the manual pipeline that you're doing and how can we make it better in the optimized way?\n\n10:44 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Got it. For our clients, it is pretty much looking at the ad library, a couple of competitors in that specific area.  For example, in 10 to 15 miles, whatever my computer's radius is looking at the potential. She'll complete us and if they're running any ads in the in general, the domain, big players in that domain.  For example, in the indoor playground, Skyzone is a really big player here. So we see what Skyzone is running and based on that, we create some creatives and run and see if that is giving us any results.  And we do lead gen for birthday parties. Then again, it's the same logic for us as you give the client revenue through marketing.  And that is when they'll keep us, they'll retain us for a long time. So we give them birthday party leads revenue.  And then when they get those leads, it goes to a call center team. They call. But then again, there is a gap between because if marketing and call center don't work in collaboration, it is all going to fall down.  And they have most of the times we see the comments is of phones not being picked and stuff like that.  So we have optimized our campaign saying. So that what is the preferred time and date to call, and they give the preferred time and date, but logistically it's not working out for them to call in that specific time, so that's one more gap, but then call center team also, I think they collaborated with something, they are a completely different team from us, they're a different company, so they are bringing some voice AI agent, they're working their system out, so next one they'll have some update for us in how to execute that, I believe, not sure, but yeah, so that is the way we do pretty much looking at the ads and competitors, ads in my meta ad library and pulling things out, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, yeah, just to reiterate, I think you have, when you're working with one company, yeah, when you're working with one company, you need to have a list of all the competitors that are out there in the market, second is, what ads, what marketing campaigns they're running, on the way you check it out, on the way ad library, and do you also,\n\n13:00 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  They stalk their social media, just to understand what are they doing organically, think that's also there, Those are the three key things that you do.  And just like you mentioned that, you know, of course, marketing and sales have to be very much in collaboration because if sales is not getting converted, revenue is not getting generated and the entire blame goes on to the marketing team, essentially.  So that is one thing I agree. Actually, for that as well, like you already mentioned, they are building some voice AI agents and everything on a separate.  we actually built something like that for an HVAC business owner that they were running Facebook ads. But of course, as soon as someone clicks on these ads, there is no human engagement.  There is no engagement on the business end to the potential lead. And frankly, it is not even possible if you're able to contact 100 or 1000 leads in a day.  Correct. So for that we built a voice AI agent that as soon as someone. And fills out a form or as soon as someone essentially opens that ads and we have at least phone number from their end, our voice agent will immediately call within 15 to 20 seconds and we'll get all the details done pre, you know, an initial screening that is very much required to convert that lead.  And as well, if you're able to reach out to them within 15 seconds of them clicking on clicking on an ad psychologically, they'll be more engaged with your business.  Right. If I'm choosing a perfume plant who's doing some, some sort of meta ads or Instagram ad and I click on it, I enter my phone number and I get a call from them that, you know, hey, Prakash, we saw that you're interested in this perfume.  Do you want to buy it? I will be more inclined to buy it. Right. So these agents are actually able to help get those leads warmed up.  Quick question about that.\n\n14:49 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  So do you guys also, did you guys also figure out if they're giving a preferred time and slot to call exactly on that?  Can you schedule the calls based on the answers that they're giving out? know, want to you. Can I schedule a call based on the answers they're giving out, what does that mean to you?  So are we in the questionnaire that we ask, wherever we're getting the PII information, what is your best time to call, best day and time to call?  That is something we ask as a question so that we can give them, because most of the folks don't answer those calls.  Even if a voice AI agent is coming, if they're not picking up the call, then it's, that's a whole.  So for us, the lift rate is very, very low and they give us a, so that is where we have optimized.  Okay. What is the best time and date to call? And they give out the day and time. A few folks answer like any day in the evening after 5 PM, few folks give date and specific window.  So it's different answers right now. And that is the main gap because even right now, the call goes within 10 minutes that is figured out.  But then no one is picking up the call and we want them to call them in a specific time that they, they have given out.  So how to logistically figure that out would be my, I would be.\n\n16:01 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, if you just talk about this YCI agent thing, there are two ways that I would highly suggest this one.  So when we have questionnaire, we are asking when is the best time to call. And it's going to be normal plain English that someone says, you know, probably tomorrow, probably after my lunch or something like that.  So we need an LLM integration that can actually figure out what is the right time in numbers. What is the exact time that we need to call.  And of course, there's a call scheduler. A lot of people are not implementing that, but we implemented it basically whenever I want to call someone, it's not a direct call that I have a lead.  I just have to call it. No, for each lead, I'm assigning a time slot that I'm going to call.  So when we are assigning the time slot, I can use that questionnaire and assign the right time slot. So if I, if the person clicked on an ad, let's say 10 PM and I was going to call at 10, 10, 10 PM, 10 minutes, then instead of that, instead of calling a 10, 10, I would look at the questionnaire that they filled out.  If they said, if they said. Call me at 1 p.m. tomorrow, then I will use that number and I will schedule that call at 1 p.m.\n\n17:06 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  tomorrow.\n\n17:06 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So I have that call scheduling system integrated already. And of course, this is not the complete picture as well.  When we have this, even after calling at 1 p.m., they can say, hey, I'm a little busy. Can you call me in three hours?  Can you call me next sometime? Then we also have a call rearranger. So of course, there are two calls that we're going to do.  First is right after the ads, whatever is the scheduled time. And second is if they say, please call me at this time, then we have the second call scheduled.  But after that, if they're not engaging with us in two calls, we would not want to waste our precious, you know, money as well as time over those prospects because they are not really interested.  Right. So we also need to filter out. That's my suggestion. Of course, we can build the customer system according to your psychological.  How much do you think the setup will cost us?\n\n17:59 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Because this is... Clearly was not within our scope of, I mean, that is call center. They need to figure out that was my always mindset.  Again, it is impacting the ROI of the client, but if we have to onboard the system, how do you think roughly the cost will look like?\n\n18:15 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah. So for this, the first one-time setup is just going to be, you know, it's actually not a one-time setup when we are doing engaging with calls and per minute system.  So it's going to be a monthly retainer type of thing. Because in that sense, what we need is, it's not just going to be a system that we give you.  We need to have continuous monitoring of the system, but are the calls being made? Is there any A2B protocol issue?  Is there any 2LU issue? Is there any phone number issue? Anything there can be. So essentially our team has to be active in understanding if there is an issue on the customer end or on our end.  Second thing is when we are engaging with multiple calls, if you can give me a number that in a month probably will be be doing 500 calls.  Then I Then I can.\n\n19:00 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Give you a code that, you know, for 500 calls, going to be this amount of money together, combined to all the locations, every probably 150 calls roughly 150 calls and 150 calls per month.\n\n19:25 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Right? Yeah.\n\n19:28 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yeah.\n\n19:28 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So if that's the case, it's going to cost somewhere in the range of $450 per month. Got it. Where my team will handle all the monitoring.  If there is, of course, when we are building these voice agents, there is going to be prompt re-enhancement. So we handle that as well.  You can just let us know that you can try it out. If you say after a month that, you know, hey, let's try to make the wording no change.  Let's try to make change the voice or something like that. can do that. Got it.\n\n19:56 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  One second. Let me make a note of this. Again, this is not something I was... I'm honestly looking forward for this.  Now that I know this is feasible, I'm just going to make a note of it and see how it fits in within our system.\n\n20:14 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  See, essentially, the purpose is just to get, how can we get more clients to a business? When we do that, I think everything is part of my business.  So I need to make sure that anything that you need, it's being handled by us. I know, I know.\n\n20:29 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  But if the 450 has to go out of our pocket instead of the call center, then there's a lot that we need to pitch in and then that is going to go from us.  So we need to get that sort of revenue in our hand to even pass it on to you. And that's going to be a recurring cost on a monthly basis.  So that is where a lot of decision making folks need to come in. And we have a lot to figure out within our marketing scope, even going, jumping onto the sales.  And again, we are ROs. So that is the reason why I was like, okay, let me listen this out and see how it works out.  But I need to first make conversations with co-founder. If this is something, if we add, this is an add on feature, are there something folks that will be interested?  And first it needs to be pilot testing. They need to build confidence. Okay. For one location it's happening before we make it like, well, uh, around all the clients.  So that is interesting. And if this is even not happening for hyperkits, we are like the, the legion that I'm talking about for all the FCC industries, we want to get into indoor playgrounds or kids space very first.  So those needs, we can have a conversation with them. Like, Hey, we can take care of the voice agent and put it as a package and send it out to them.  And if it's working out, then, you know, we can work it out internally.\n\n21:47 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  But if I just ask you another question that, you know, when we say that we need to have a con, I mean, when we are deciding these things, is it just going to be the co-founder of the company?  I think. Shri energy it is, or is it, uh, the, uh, client's information, do we need to get confirmation from the client or from our, so when it comes to Srinergy, it's Srinergy is basically an Indian company and then U.S.\n\n22:14 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  company name is Stratcore Media, so you'll be hearing two names along the way. Now we are a fully marketing agency and we want to get into automation and AI space and for the clients where it's a call center and that comes into the page, they are associated with a different company altogether.  They are not doing well and ultimately I'm also seeing from the lens, Hey, I want to show results. I want to prove them results that we have achieved XYZ, but ultimately if this is not happening and birthday parties is something where decision making happens, where parents decide they discuss with their own parents because it's a big scale, but they're celebrating and they're essentially spending around $300 on one single day.  That's like the base plate. That is like the first year package. So. It takes a little bit of decision making before they make a purchase.  It's not like a dress or a cycle where they can just order it on Myntra and then it shows up.  So since it takes a little bit of its service-based, decision-based, call center team plays a major role and that is where they are lacking and I'm like, what do we do about it?  But I know you have given us a solution on what is the best way and I would love to get that into the process, but I'm not sure if that is something we can indulge in, add it on a package.  We didn't expect that to be scope of our work. We want to get our marketing get into a better place first and maybe very later in the pipeline.  Never even thought of getting a call center or giving a voice agent as a particular part yet. Yeah, I agree.\n\n23:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  I think it's more of an additional thing. So I have a question for you. When we talk about that, you know, this voice agent is not on your end.  It's more on the sales team end. Yeah. When we get noted, uh, how So is the actual pain point that you're facing?  And how can you scale to more revenue? If I just ask you these two questions, because that is my entire goal.  So how can you how what do you think you are going to implement to get more revenue from the clients?  And second is, you know, what is the actual pain point that you're targeting?\n\n24:18 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Got it. Our pain point is people call center team not giving them a call in a particular time slot, whenever the client has mentioned or whenever the customer has mentioned call me at this around this time, call not being gone.  And then second follow up, there should be at least three, three follow ups in a week for continuously two weeks.  So there should be six follow ups that will be going on. And that will give us an understanding. So when these conversions, that is our main pain point with the sales team.  That is not able to handle. Now, when it comes to us, we are able to generate probably 15 to 20 leads per month with the budgets that they have, they have super low budgets when it comes to  So a of clients have decent budget, couple of clients have low budget, but I want to have whatever ad spend is happening.  I want to get the best results out of it. I don't want to bleed money anywhere by testing out or, you know, maybe the person who is monitoring was leave on like three days and they were like just out there in the market on the ads and no one optimized it.  And then when it comes to the third day, it might not be his first priority. could probably looking at some client and by the time he comes here, there is already like a hundred dollars that we have misused.  I don't want to bleed money or waste money on that. Uh, ideally want, is there any AI system that we can come into the picture where it optimizes, gives alerts that, Hey, this campaign from this location is giving XYZ issue.  You need to immediately make this sort of changes and he can come back and make changes. Creatives are not up to the mark.  And even before uploading the creative system anywhere we can, you know, uh, have some sort of AI screening saying that this is up to mark, this is below mark, and this is not so that according to the, all the competition.  Profiters, creatives or competitors, or in general industry standards, and then make a decision. So that is where my lead gen I want to make stronger for my clients, and paid media, these are the two things I thought could be a scope and wanted to check with you on those things.  Apart from that lead gen for our own as a company, we want lead gen, we want more clients. So that is our major focus, that would be our major focus for sure.  yeah so when we talk about 15 to 20 leads per month is this for one location or is this for the entire us location one location and we are dealing with how many locations about uh 10 locations right now i mean two of the locations are still before they didn't open the doors but we're doing pre-marketing they're opening in march april so we're just doing pre-marketing for them so yeah yeah the way we are getting these 15 to 20 leads it is only from metads right only from metads not google yet yeah so the the leads that if we get\n\n27:00 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  It's 20 leads for one location. almost 200 leads that we're If you're able to convert, right now, how many leads are we converting?  And to which number should we go to?\n\n27:14 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Uh, right now from 150 leads, probably we are converting. It's very low 25 to 30, not even 25 to 30.  Honestly, it's 20 to 25 on a good season, on a good season. Like for example, winters is a good season.  So this is our conversion rate. And, uh, we want at least out of, uh, do you want to read somewhere 60 to 70% conversion rate?  So almost, I think 90 leads. Yeah. Okay. Close to that.\n\n27:52 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So, uh, when you talk about getting 90 leads closed, are we also looking to increase the number of 152 problems?  So there are two ways that we can increase, if we increase the number of leads or if we increase the conversion rate.  So are we targeting both or are we targeting one thing? It's going to be both.\n\n28:12 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  We want to increase our conversion rate from percentage XYZ to XYZ plus one. And then the number of leads again is dependent on client's budget.  If they don't give us a budget, there is hardly that we can increase the leads. So I, as of now, whatever budget they're giving us, if it is $100 per month, hypothetically, I want to make a good use of $100 and not bleed like $20 of that.  And then, you know, the rest of the amount is being used, but I want to make sure $100 is being actually useful and there is no bleeding of money.  Okay.\n\n28:48 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So ideally, even if we, since we are limited on $100, think 150 to 200 leads is actually the top most that we are able to get.  I think $100 is my hypothetical number.\n\n28:59 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  think we're spending about. $500-$600. Per location, we're spending close to $400-$500. Again, these are the very lowest budgets I've ever worked with.  I've worked with very huge budgets in the past, but with this client, whoever's business is running well, they don't tend to spend a lot.  So, since the brand is anyways driving. Yeah.\n\n29:23 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  And what should be the ideal ticket size for that business? I mean, for one lead, how much are they averagely spending?\n\n29:30 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  It starts from $200 and it goes up to $1,000.\n\n29:34 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Okay, so the product that they're selling is from $200 to $1,000. Yeah. Okay, fair. So for 90 leads, think they're almost making, I'd say, $1,000 is a rare thing.\n\n29:47 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  It's only a private party where they book an entire day. They book the entire space. So it's rare that they can buy in 2000.  Maybe let's make an Average of $350, so yeah, per lead, maybe that could be. And even if you're taking the 20 leads that we are generating at $7,000 for all the locations combined, it's not just one.  So if I'm dividing it by eight, as of now, it is hardly 875. So we're just, if they're giving us $400, we're giving them about $800 to business.  That's all. But I want to have that in a bigger, bigger numbers, bigger scale. Okay.\n\n30:29 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, so for $400, I think we need to focus on both fronts, I agree and see, the thing is, when you talk about convert conversion rate, I don't think it's dependent on the digital marketing team, rather it's dependent on the sales team only.  So I understand your frustration when you say that, know, sales team is not following up with them properly. One way is that we can go towards increasing the conversion rate by taking control in our own hands that, you know, you are spending $500.\n\n30:57 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Okay.\n\n30:58 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  I understand. say. No. No. No. Let me take care of the conversion rate by properly putting up follow-up systems, not just voice-y agent, we can also have follow-up systems like, you know, we're sending them emails, WhatsApp campaigns.  Oh, yeah, that is happening.\n\n31:12 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  That is something, recent update that we have done. So patch is something that we have asked a client to buy that we didn't want to take the responsibility of tech stack.  So we've asked, we've given a couple of options, and patch is something for their specific industry they have built out in a SaaS system.  So email and SMS, even building automations, like whoever didn't visit from 90 days, sending out the SMS or email campaign with a code, all these things have been set up.  And last month we have just connected our Google leads to patch through an API connection, and now a little bit of messaging and everything is being approved.  So next week somewhere, we need to, we'll be getting this live. So that part is sorted. We have taken.  So the control through email and SMS part. How that is going to perform will have next two months to see the data and then we will be deciding on how to optimize and stuff.  But yeah, that is that is definitely happening. But for as a company, we don't have any email system. When we want to do our own lead gen, that is where we will be looking into, you know, email and SMS marketing and stuff like that.\n\n32:22 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So right now, Shriya, if you talk about the lead generation, the competitive analysis. So for when we're doing competitive analysis, basically you're targeting the, can we improve our own ads?\n\n32:37 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  As an agency to see, not just for hyper kids, I'm giving you that as a use case because that's our major client and we want to, we don't want to drop the boat with them.  We want to do the best before they even come back and ask. But ideally, with our paid leads, how can any AI system help us out?  Is there any automation we can do? That is one of my very, very curious, not just for meta ads, but Google ads as well.  Number two, we need to build our own lead gen funnel, which works on autopilot, where I don't have to figure out every month, oh no, is Google Ads running?  How is everything happening? Is there any? I know there's a lot of funnels people are building these days. I was curious to check with you if that is something that anything that you have in mind, or anything that we build out on discussions.  One thing is that my goal, instead of going through webinar and then booking a call, directly booking a call would be my first lead gen activity.  And then webinar, if some, if I have, if my conversion rates are pretty bad, then that is where I will be probably thinking about getting into webinar route.  But yeah, that's my top of the, that's one of the, my thought process at the moment. What was the third thing I remember paid is one thing I mentioned.\n\n33:52 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  The third thing I think I mentioned was talking about FEC and Endo Playground. So I think the third thing was getting the conversion rate up.  And the first two things were lead generation and the ad for computer analysis.\n\n34:05 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yeah, yes.\n\n34:08 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, so I think we are, let me just drag back. When we discussed that for this voice AI agent as well as the conversion rate, I think it's a very small problem that you're targeting for your end.  think your first problem is going to be getting more leads into your own digital marketing agency.\n\n34:28 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yeah, I know it's a small scale, but then if you're doing lead gen, fulfillment is very important, right? Like if you're not able to do a proper fulfillment, then it is going to be an issue for us.  So we want to, that is where like my Feb and March month goals were like, make the team strong, make the systems build strong, so that I don't have to worry when the client comes in.  See, logging a client is tough, but when it happens, you need to maintain that sort of work ethic and then that sort of results need to show up.  when that is failing again, everything will go bad. I don't even know. If I get 10 clients, good, they will give me more business end of the day, true word of mouth.  So that is a reason why, even though it looks like a small, but then it's a very big factor for us to have a strong system in place and ultimately paid ads is like blood of the company.  The more you have good paid ads, everything is branding, it's bottom funnel, top funnel, I mean, middle funnel, top funnel, paid ads is literally a bottom funnel, which will convert into ROI.  So that is the first thing that I want to tackle and make the system stronger, see what is out there, AI automation, whatever it is, I want to keep that system in place, and then figure out the rest of the things later part is later.  Fair enough.\n\n35:40 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So I think our focus comes back to competitor analysis on the paid ads. And that is something that you will be utilizing for FEC, Hyperkids, and probably any other leads that you have.\n\n35:53 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Any client, it's not just Hyperkids. It's competitors, one, two, paid ads, able to give us that sort of. Let's say this guy is running good or not, AI able to give that sort of information.  So Compton analysis is one small chunk of it as a whole paid ads. Then when there are like 30 campaigns running across all the clients, let's take a ballpark number here, 30 different campaigns happening as a digital marketing agency.  are running 30 different campaigns for all our clients able to monitor by folks. It just increases our service to higher ratio.  We don't want to keep hiring folks for every five clients and then we will never be able to make profits out of this business.  So that is where we want to get into an AI where it will monitor, it will do the part, at least when the setup is done, will monitor and it will tell, hey, this just needs to be fixed, your campaign is going bad, you need to come back and fix this, this just needs to happen, probably your creative is bad, CTR is low, so your creative is bad, your budgets are low, increase the budget and your campaign will run good.  So these sort of optimization solutions, it will throw out, it will go. I have also seen one tool called Go Marble.  I don't know if you have heard about it, but Go Marble is something that all the D2C marketing agencies are using, probably didn't get a lot of chance to research on it or test it out, but was thinking on my back of, and I need to research on what other tools are there.  But before even getting into that, I wanted to check with you, because I know last time we spoke and it didn't, the deal didn't get through because we scaled back on SEO, we found it too complicated.  But yeah, paid is something we want to heavily go if I'm finding the right fit.\n\n37:36 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Okay, so focusing on paid ads, paid ads, I think are just reiterating on your thought, our goal is that whenever we're working with any business, we just create a monitor that, hey, this is a business, fine, keep updating the competitor list, keep checking out the competitor ads, and keep tracking their budgets, their things, what are they doing, so that  It can compare to our current ads. It has also the data of our current ads. It keep comparing them.  And every, probably every single day or probably every single week, it runs, it checks, and it gives you a report that, you know, we are good or we are bad and we need to improve these and these things.\n\n38:16 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  I think that's what we're looking for. That is one aspect of seeing, but then even without comparing with the competitor, our own ads with the metrics you see, you should be able to, it should be able to suggest some things.  For example, if our reach and impressions are high and click through rate is low, that the story, the metrics that Ford is trying to tell me is your creative is bad.  Or if my click through rate is high, my reach is high. And if the lead is not getting converted, something is happening with the feed, something is going off, how to fix that part.  So every metric, something is high, something is low, will tell me some sort of story. If my reach and impressions are not high, that means my budget is not enough probably.  Or maybe my creative is absolutely bad, something between these two will come in too. So. So even before comparing with the competitors, because you won't get competitors' result of how much they are spending, what is their, you will get to know they're creative, but you will never get to know if it's a performing ad or not.  So you need to check your own campaign and based on the metrics it's showing, make developments according to it.\n\n39:19 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Fair.\n\n39:19 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  And this applies for Meta and Google when I'm seeing all these things. Yeah.\n\n39:24 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So are we looking at something like a Slack integration or because I think it's more of a chat bot for you on the front end, but on the back end it's going to be doing a lot of things.  But for someone as a client, I just want reports on email or WhatsApp or Slack or anything like that, right?\n\n39:39 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yeah, we have Google Workspace, maybe getting updates on our Google Workspace would be easier because the entire team works, chats through that.  Okay. Yeah.\n\n39:48 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah. So I think Google Workspace works and we, we will have the, so all we need is the report that this is working.  This is not working. Do this. Do.\n\n39:59 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Correct. On a daily basis. it's doing good, then yeah, it's good. So for this location, for this client, XYZ client, you're running three campaigns.  Campaign one is performing this way, campaign two is performing this way, campaign three is performing this this way. This is monitoring.  It's going good. Keep continuing. I see some changes. Maybe you need to get back and monitor it and fix some things.  And then in terms of, again, the second part is what you mentioned, competitors, what ads are they running? And then, you know, giving suggestions in the loop, it has to keep giving suggestions so that we don't have to manually go back and check our computers and it will give us all the list at one place.\n\n40:40 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Makes sense. And I think that is, I understand this. Let me just go back and you know, let me just have a conversation with my team on what will be the right schema for you.  And at the same time, can you share me probably some of your competitors? competitors, and Yeah, one brand that you're targeting, one or two brands or whatever you're working with and their competitors and let me just try it out on my, on my end, what is going on, what is, because I think when we have this on service level, it will be fine, but that surface level automation is something.  It's not going to get you the right results, but I would like to build you is something that is actually going into the depth of it for that.  Let me just have that experimentation in mind that I try it out myself and I will let you know that, you know, this is working good and this is not, and probably we can have a call by, uh, let's say Tuesday and I can come up with a schema with you that, you know, this is, this is what I have an idea for.  And, uh, these are the APIs and all these things that we are going to implement and I can quote with, I can, I think accordingly.  Okay. Fair enough.\n\n41:47 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Fair enough. Uh, this is again, the internal part I've mentioned, like within our services. is one of the upgrade now, uh, want to understand.  Is there any automated leadgen that we can build out? Have you ever built out like legions for digital marketing agencies and any insights on that, on how to go about it or what system we can build together?\n\n42:12 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Yeah, for that, let me just quickly mention one thing. When you're talking about leadgen, I think just probably one or two years back, I used to think leadgen is, if it is a leadgen, I know that it is going to generate leads.  But ideally, when we talk, when I, when I have, I know dove deeper into it, what I realized that leadgen is actually quite a big segment.  Every company, every business, even in the same segment will have to have a different type of leadgen, because your positioning is different.  My positioning is different and someone probably your sister company's positioning is going to be different. So what happens is when you talk about lead generation, it's going to be first, I have to understand very much about your own business.  What type of clients you're targeting? What is the ICP? What is the, oh, yeah.\n\n42:59 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Oh, yeah. Perfect.\n\n43:02 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So what are the methods that you are currently getting your leads from? Right? And then I will have to dive more into the sense that what is lead generation in your own niche?  Probably, there are some other people that are trying out some new segments, some new other things. And then we would like to build your own lead generation system because I have worked with lead generation system.\n\n43:21 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  And for every business that I've worked with, had to, yeah, as I said, So how things went about is initially we targeted all the Indians in us who have businesses because it's easier to penetrate.  We just felt at the same ethnicity. comfort level is high. we started that way. And one of the client did reach one.  We got one response, a couple of responses out of that one went ahead. that is being hyper kids. Now, when we tapped into that, we understood it's a very big market.  And then there, he has like a So five to six already up franchises where a very mediocre team is doing marketing and that was frustrating him.  So it worked out very favorably. think luck was on our side as well at that point of time. So we did it for a very, very, almost near to free marketing for three months.  And he liked our work. And that is when we were able to scale up. And now it is all paid gigs.  We're getting paid for all the franchises. Every new franchise comes in. It's a new opportunity for us to give them a presentation and lock in.  And then we have that client in our bucket. So saying that, that was the first, very first initial legion plan and it worked out and that turned out to be a very big client.  So we never had to do a legion again. The other clients that we have are all word of mouth.  All my previous, when I worked in India, all the folks who know business over there, I reached out and they all gave their businesses to me.  So literally, that's the next part of the business. So it's not like crazy Legion we have ever done. But our ICP is, again, starting off with indoor playground, trampoline parks, because we know the system for it.  We have to just replicate the system for them. So it is sorted for us. Healthcare and wellness also pretty much I know marketing style goes in the same style.  So these are the two things. Ideally, we want to target someone who's in the franchises because we can once if we do a good marketing for one franchise, it's immediate visible.  to all the other franchises, either they will copy our style, or they'll come back at us and reach out saying that, hey, what are you guys doing?  I want to work with you. Ideally, someone who has one or two franchises because they won't figure out about marketing, they'll be figuring it out how to run the operations of their own businesses yet.  So that that is the ICP that we have. Again, I can send you out the document that we have on the ICP in detail on everything.  But on a high level, franchises, newbie franchises who are the Thinking to get franchised in future, healthcare, FEC industry, within the FEC industry also, kids space FEC is something we want to target first, and this can be global, not just limited to USA, and their paying capacity should be minimum of $3,000 per month, and yeah, that's pretty much our initial level, and for hypercaries, I was thinking of webinar, not for hypercaries, but FEC were thinking of webinars, how much of in-depth industry knowledge we have, because ultimately, as I said before, we want to show ourselves as industry leaders, and FEC and health and wellness, FEC, we have gaged one and a half year of knowledge of the industry as well, so that is probably something we will be talking on more on webinars, and how we as a marketing, since we know, understand the industry very well, and we will give them extra insights on the industry that they were not aware of, and that will help us, you know, close the deal, so that is pretty much us, you start.  I have in my mind right now, for webinars, if that is something we want to add to our lead gen, then that is how the route will be going in.  Yeah.\n\n47:10 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So when we are doing these lead generation marketing, the thing is, I've actually read a few things about them as well.  Webinar is a thing. It's very fancy thing to do, and it is actually quite good in the results end.  But what I would suggest is that we do multiple ends. So we are also, there are also cold emails that people send for lead generation.  There's also content that people create. And then there's, of course, the funnels that is through webinar or that is through, you know, free, probably free PDFs that you can provide, you know, some sort of free information that you want to provide.  Webinar is what you're providing information for free on the surface level. And then anyone who wants to dive deep, they pay for the, they pay for your services.  So essentially, if you just break down the webinar thing, I think it's, it's also, you can also provide some content.  So free information to different people through different content or even running ads on that and people will eventually give out their information, probably their email and all these things to you and you can use that email list to send out cold emails.  So what I'm basically saying is webinar is one thing that you should definitely target. Do you have testimonials from these clients?\n\n48:21 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  We don't. We are. So what happened is, again, them being all Indian folks, I don't know how much of value that will bring in because it's all about it.  There is no diversity in our testimonials at this point. We have been behind, but I can get that is what I was thinking to getting the testimonials.  But then they take it in the video. They don't know how to give a proper testimonial. It has to be very efficient testimonial, right?  Some of the testimonials, yeah, they do an amazing work. I love working with them. That's all. No, I want some insightful testimonial.  And I know a person who can give me that insightful testimonial, but she's super busy. She's also talking\n\n50:00 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  never spoken to her, and if I just send you an email that, hey, Shriya, if you want a blog writing automation, I can get you this.  It's not, it's actually going to go, yeah, okay, okay, that's good.\n\n50:10 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Give me one second. I'm so sorry about that. Yeah.\n\n50:19 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.\n\n50:23 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah.\n\n50:35 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So all I'm saying is when we are doing these cold emails, it has to be in a sequence and the first email cannot have the direct link.  So basically you have to nurture these leads. We have to provide free value. have to provide, make sure that we are providing, hitting them into the right pain points and all these things.  after those one or two emails, we want to send out the right testimonials to prove our words. Hmm. Right.  That's why I'm saying that let's collect all the testimonials that we can get so that when you're targeting customers, we send out different testimonials to different people so that it's a diversity.  Yep. Yeah. And when you talk about, I can get this content pieces up to you.\n\n51:18 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Like probably this month, I'll be focusing on getting the content pieces from everyone, creating PDF, eBooks, webinar material, presentations, even like email sequencing.  What should my content look like? can create a workflow for that, uh, testimonials, all these things I can give, create that material, get that material ready.  Uh, but the only thing is I don't have time. Like right now, the team is filled with their own clients.  I don't have the capacity, even like creating my, building my own social media for the Stratco page, creating LinkedIn content for Stratco page, or even creating the, we have the website up, but there are so many changes that needs to be done.  And SEO, we have never looked. So we never got a chance to work on our own thing. So even with now Legion, I know I won't have a lot of time to work because I'll be juggling between the operations.  I'm still not out of the operations. I'm within the operations, very heavily invested in the operation. So I can get all these things done, but I wanted a system where things happen automatically.  Again, email part, get MailChimp, put a workflow, things happen. That is okay. But once we get a lead, getting the calls booked, I think that is part.  How, what is the entire system? Automating is something I'm curious.\n\n52:35 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  When we talk about lead generation, I'm just, I'm not just talking about creating a cold emailing automation. What my goal is going to be when I say that I want to get you more leads, I want to get you more booked calls.  Everything beforehand, everything. Let's talk about outreach. Let's talk about lead nurturing. Let's talk about cold emails, social media, DMs, and all these things.  I would like to take in charge and I would like my team to. And the only thing that you need is probably get on a call, convince them that it matters.  The same thing that you're doing with the clients, you know, you're creating the marketing, you're doing all these things, but you don't have the sales power, right?  I would do both of the things I would do cold outreach and I will do the engagement with them so that we can get them on a call with you.  We will use your own cal.com or Calendly link to book a call with you. We will have the enough information beforehand so that we know what, what is going to happen on the call.  You, you take on in charge, you take on the lead there, you convert that call. And that's where you get.  So my goal, if we talk about lead generation, my entire goal is going to be, how can I get more leads to you?  Got it. And, uh, yeah, and let me just, uh, when you talk about this lead generation, since I've, you know, I've actually given a very, uh, detailed understanding.  just want to know, uh, how much are we looking to invest into the paid ad competitor analysis automation? And the second one is lead generation, because one is for.  So I just want to have a graph idea of where is the main priority on the numbers and what are the real numbers on how much can we invest.\n\n54:14 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  So the paid are definitely looking somewhere below. I want it to be a one-time setup. We cannot afford a recurring setup, that is for sure.  So keeping that one setup somewhere between 2.5k, it would be our budget. That 2.5k is like max. And then with our lead gen, probably like $300 per month is something we can get started.  Yeah, $300 per month is something we can get started.\n\n54:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So when we say $300 per month, how much? So one lead, I think it's going to be at least $3,000 per month, right?  If we are able to convert one lead?\n\n54:56 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  If they are able to convert, yeah. So it's going to be at least $3,000.\n\n54:59 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Okay. So is it safe to say for, if I get you one or two leads, at least it will be a good ROI for you to spend $300.\n\n55:09 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yep. Yep.\n\n55:12 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  When you're targeting, I think I'm going to get you better numbers only. I'm just saying that I just wanted to keep a context that at least 10 times ROI is something that I'm actually looking to give as well.  If you're investing $1,000 in me, I'm looking to get you $10,000 of the, yeah.\n\n55:28 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Yeah.\n\n55:28 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  So let me just, for leads and I think I need information from your end. What is ICB? More information about the business and the testimonials that you're getting, right?  And for the competitor analysis, we can have a call probably on Tuesday. I can get you the real architecture of what the competitor analysis automation is going to look like and what is going to be the code for it.\n\n55:49 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  So we can start with the competitor analysis one and probably in the hypercats so that you just have, you know, some starting point.  And I'll send you that on WhatsApp. No worries. Absolutely.\n\n56:04 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  As soon as we are satisfied on the competitive analysis, we can start that one. Parallel, we'll have a few more conversations on lead generation so that I understand the way we're going to implement this.  And that way we can have working on that. Yeah.\n\n56:20 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Got it. And in general, right now, know I'm going through SEO. So our blog writing is pretty much, you know, it's, it's there.  We have find out a way, but that's the only thing we could automate. Now, is there anything? Yeah. My third requirement was actually now that I remember website.  The auto updates that go on the website and the pop ups that go on the website, it has to get automatically removed in like 24 hours.  I'll give you to schedule time, like the five hours, you need to, it needs to go off. Is that something we can work out?  In five hours, what needs to go off? Oh, okay. For example, right now I am. I am. I am.  And then there is a private party event that got booked. Whenever a private party gets booked, that means that no one can come in.  It's just booked for the party owners. So we put up a pop up on our website, on our Instagram saying that we are closed until 5pm or they're closed from this time to this time.  Suppose if there's a weather, it's snored very crazily in the last week and all the operations were off, all the businesses were off.  So they had to put out a pop up saying that we are off for businesses. Now, if I forget to remove that pop up and if it stays for longer time for two days, then for two days, people won't turn up because they'll see that pop up that, hey, these people are closed because of the snow.  Maybe they're taking instead of one day, it's taking longer for them and they'll not come. So that way, it's a lost revenue for the client and these pop ups look very small, but then it takes a big impact and toll on the revenue part.  So that is why we want to automate whenever we have a pop up, you know, it automatically goes for, we need to give it a time.  ESvelt So, Bye. So is this something we can do, the whole pop-up parts, and then if we can even connect it to our stories, website, Instagram stories is one thing we do, and then I don't even care about the Instagram right now, website mainly, it has to go up and go down in a specific hours, and if that is happening automatically without human intervention, that's a huge, huge, huge challenge.  Less pain in our .\n\n58:32 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  I understand, I think we can handle that, don't worry.\n\n58:35 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Okay, let me know how, what's the quotation looks like on this, do you need any information from my end?\n\n58:42 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  On that, yeah, when you talk about the pop-up to go up and down, I think it's going to be a scheduled system, so basically you just put some information on a Google form, let's say, that you know, this is the information that you want to create a pop-up on, it should start at this time, it should end at this time.  And it should automatically put it on your website. should automatically take it down. I think this is a type of system that we're looking at.  Okay. Yeah. I mean, just an example, we can have multiple different variations of it as well. But yeah, I would just need to take a look at your website code base so that I know what, how are going to make it work?  If I can see the code base, I can probably give you an estimate on how much time it is going to take and what is going to be the price code for that as well.\n\n59:30 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Got it. Give me the list of questions you need or requirements you need to handle this one and we'll take things out from there.  I'll give you all that information.\n\n59:39 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Absolutely. So I think we spoke about three things. Website popup, competitor analysis and the lead generation. I'll just send you a quick summary on WhatsApp that, you know, for competitor analysis, I need these things.  And this is what I will do for lead generation. I'll do the same and for the popup, I'll do the same.  Okay.\n\n59:55 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Sounds good. Perfect. That's okay. Thank you so much and apologies. I couldn't make it to the last call.\n\n1:00:02 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  That's okay. No worries. I hope that things are okay now. Yeah, that's fine.\n\n1:00:06 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Everything is good. Okay. Looking forward to next call, Prakash. My Monday is Tuesday. It's actually pretty, pretty booked. So when I say something, I'll try to schedule.  If you say that you have some inputs, then I'll try to schedule post Wednesday. And I'll give you information wise.  I know I need to give you ICP, business info, testimonials. It's not something happening right now, but ICP and business info I can give you.  Competitors, I'll be giving you for paid ads thing. And for website, I will be waiting from you for the questions.  And then I'll give that information to you. Yeah, no worries.\n\n1:00:40 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Okay.\n\n1:00:40 - Shriya Yerrabelly (Srinergy Global)\n  Sounds good then. Thank you so much, Prakash. a good rest of the day. Take care. Bye-bye. Thank you, Shriya.\n\n1:00:46 - Prakarsh Gupta (prakarshgupta02051@gmail.com)\n  Thank you.

No more back-and-forth.\n\n---\n\n## PRE-CALL INTEL\n\n| What We Know | Why It Matters |\n|---|---|\n| Managing 30+ campaigns across 10 HyperKidz locations, small team | She needs automation — hiring for every 5 clients kills margins |\n| Staff leave = unmonitored campaigns = $100+ wasted per incident | Money is being lost right now.

Set expectations. Plant the close.\n\n> \"Shriya, thanks for getting on. I want to be upfront about how I want to spend the next 40 minutes.\n>\n> After our last conversation, I went deep on your three problems — the paid ad monitoring, the lead gen for Stratgo Media, and the website popup situation. I've put together three separate systems, each one designed around exactly what you told me.\n>\n> Here's how this will go: I'll do a quick recap to make sure nothing's changed on your end. Then I'll walk you through each system — what it is, exactly how it works, what it gives you, and what it costs. Three systems. Each one independent. You can pick one, two, or all three.\n>\n> At the end, there's really only two answers — yes, let's move on one of these, or no, it's not the right time. The one thing I want to avoid is 'let me think about it' — because we've been going back and forth for over a month now, and I think we both deserve a clear answer. Fair?\"\n\n**[Wait for agreement.]**\n\n---\n\n## STEP 2: QUICK DISCOVERY RECAP (10 minutes)\n\n**Goal:** Confirm priorities, get her re-stating her pain, then bridge to the pitch.\n\n### Confirm Priorities:\n\n> \"Before I share my screen, let me make sure I'm aligned with where you are right now. Last time you told me three things:\n>\n> One — you're running 30+ campaigns across all your clients on Meta and Google, and when someone on your team is out, campaigns bleed money. You said you want to 'make good use of every dollar and not bleed twenty of it.'\n>\n> Two — you have no lead gen system for Stratgo Media. All your clients have come through word of mouth. You want automated outreach to budding franchisees in FEC and health and wellness.\n>\n> Three — the website popup situation. If a private party popup stays up one extra day, the client loses an entire day of walk-in revenue.\n>\n> Has anything changed? Are these still the three priorities?\"\n\n**[Let her confirm or add context. Listen for any new info.]**\n\n### Future State (get her excited):\n\n> \"So if we fast-forward 6 months and all three of these are solved — what does Stratgo Media look like? How many clients? What's the revenue?\"\n\n**[Let her paint the picture. Use her numbers later in the close.]**\n\n### Current State Pain (bring her down to reality):\n\n> \"That's the goal. Now, right now — how is your team actually keeping up with monitoring 30 campaigns? How many hours a week is someone spending just checking ad accounts?\"\n\n> \"And the popup thing — how many times in the last couple months has a popup stayed up longer than it should?\"\n\n> \"You told me on our last call that you're 'still not out of the operations, very heavily invested in the operations.' Is that still true?\"\n\n### Bridge:\n\n> \"So here's the gap, Shriya: you want to scale to industry leaders in FEC and health and wellness. But right now, your time is going into monitoring campaigns, chasing popup removals, and you haven't had a chance to build any outreach system for your own business. You said it yourself — 'we never got a chance to work on our own thing.'\n>\n> Let me show you what I'd build. Three systems. Each one takes a specific problem off your plate.\"\n\n**[Share screen. Open pitch deck.]**\n\n---\n\n## STEP 3: PRESENT 3 SYSTEMS (20 minutes)\n\n**Open pitch deck. Walk through slides in order.**\n\n> \"I'm going to walk you through three independent systems. Each one solves a different problem. For each one, I'll show you what it is, exactly how it works end-to-end, what you get, and what it costs.\"\n\n**[Slide 1: Title]** — Quick pause, let her see the overview.\n\n**[Slide 2: Three Systems Overview]**\n\n> \"Here's the big picture. Three systems. Ad Intelligence, Lead Generation, and Website Automation. Each one is independent — you can pick one, two, or all three. Let me walk you through each one.\"\n\n---\n\n### SYSTEM 1: AD INTELLIGENCE & OPTIMIZATION\n\n**[Slide 3: What & Why]**\n\n> \"System one. This is the one you were most vocal about on our last call.\n>\n> You're running 30+ campaigns across 10 locations. When someone's on leave for three days — your words — 'there's already a hundred dollars we've misused.' You want to make every dollar count. And you said you don't want to keep hiring people for every five new clients.\n>\n> On the left, that's the problem. On the right, that's what this system does. It monitors every campaign across every client, every day. It diagnoses what's wrong — bad creative, low budget, form issue — and tells your team exactly what to fix. It also tracks your competitors automatically, so no more manually checking Meta Ad Library for Sky Zone and Urban Air.\"\n\n**[Slide 4: How It Works]**\n\n> \"Here's exactly how the pipeline works, end to end.\n>\n> First, I connect to all your Meta and Google ad accounts. Then every day, the system pulls the data — impressions, CTR, reach, conversions, spend. AI analyzes it against benchmarks. At the same time, it scans your competitors' ads from Meta Ad Library. Then it generates a daily report with specific action items and pushes it straight to your Google Workspace.\n>\n> Your team opens Google Workspace in the morning, and it's all there. Which campaigns are fine. Which ones need attention. And exactly what to do about it.\n>\n> Look at these diagnosis examples. CTR is high but conversions are low? The system tells you it's a landing page or form issue for that specific location. Reach is high but CTR is low? Creative is underperforming — and it'll cross-reference what competitors are running so you know what formats to try. Reach and impressions are low? Budget issue. These are the exact metric stories you described on our last call.\"\n\n**[Slide 5: What You Get + Price]**\n\n> \"Here's what you get: daily campaign performance reports per client per location, AI-powered diagnosis with specific fix suggestions, automated competitor tracking, weekly competitor creative summaries, all pushed to Google Workspace. And it scales — every new client you onboard, you just add their accounts.\n>\n> The investment: $2,500, one-time. I build it, deploy it across all your current clients, train your team, and give you two weeks of post-launch support. Split payment — $1,250 upfront, $1,250 on delivery.\n>\n> Tool costs are separate and yours to own: N8N, AI API, hosting — roughly $70 to $150 a month.\n>\n> I want to be clear about something: this system delivers monitoring, alerts, and competitor data. Those are the outputs. I'm not guaranteeing revenue numbers or conversion rates — how your team acts on the alerts is what drives results. The system gives you the information. You make the decisions.\"\n\n**[Pause. Let her absorb.]**\n\n> \"Questions about system one before I move to system two?\"\n\n---\n\n### SYSTEM 2: LEAD GENERATION PIPELINE\n\n**[Slide 6: What & Why]**\n\n> \"System two. This is about Stratgo Media's own growth.\n>\n> You've built to $10k a month entirely through word of mouth. That got you HyperKidz, that got you the health and wellness client. But word of mouth doesn't run on a schedule. You told me you 'never got a chance to work on your own thing' — no social media, no LinkedIn, no email outreach. This system puts your prospecting on autopilot.\n>\n> It finds prospects that match your ICP, runs cold email sequences, does LinkedIn outreach, classifies responses, and books qualified calls directly on your calendar. Your only job is to show up and close.\"\n\n**[Slide 7: How It Works]**\n\n> \"Here's the pipeline. First, we define the targeting — your ICP: budding franchisees with one or two locations, FEC and health and wellness, USA, Australia, UK, Dubai, Canada. Minimum $3,000 service charge, minimum $3,500 ad spend.\n>\n> Then lead sourcing — we pull verified contacts from databases and LinkedIn. Then email outreach kicks in — multi-step sequences, value-first, hitting their pain points. At the same time, LinkedIn runs in parallel — connection requests, profile engagement, follow-ups. And at the end of the pipeline: interested prospects get a link to book a call directly on your calendar.\n>\n> On the right, you can see the email sequence structure. Email one leads with an industry insight and pain point. Email two drops value — a free resource or case context. Email three adds social proof and a direct call-to-action. Email four is a gentle follow-up or breakup. LinkedIn is running alongside the whole time.\"\n\n**[Slide 8: What You Get + Price]**\n\n> \"Two options here.\n>\n> **Option A: I build it, you run it. $2,000 one-time.** You get the complete outreach infrastructure — email domains set up and warmed, ICP lead list sourced and verified, cold email sequences written and loaded, LinkedIn automation configured, response classification, calendar booking integration. Training plus two weeks of support. After that, you manage it — about 3 to 5 hours a week.\n>\n> **Option B: I build it and I run it. $500 a month.** Everything in Option A, plus I manage all outreach operations. Continuous lead sourcing, A/B testing, response handling, monthly reporting. Your only job is to show up to the calls that land on your calendar. Six-month commitment.\n>\n> Same thing as system one — the system delivers booked calls. Close rate depends on your sales conversations. I'm not guaranteeing how many clients you'll sign. I'm guaranteeing the system reaches the right people and gets them on your calendar.\n>\n> Tool costs: roughly $100 to $200 a month for email infrastructure, LinkedIn tools, and databases.\"\n\n**[Pause.]**\n\n> \"Questions about lead gen?\"\n\n---\n\n### SYSTEM 3: WEBSITE POPUP AUTOMATION\n\n**[Slide 9: What & Why]**\n\n> \"System three. This is the one you said you wanted first.\n>\n> You told me on our last call — 'it looks like a small update, but it affects the cost for the customer in a huge way.' A private party popup stays up one extra day, people see the location is closed, they don't show up. That's a full day of walk-in revenue gone. Across 8 to 10 locations, this risk is happening every week.\n>\n> This system gives your team full control. They can manually add or remove a popup from any HyperKidz website instantly — no code, no developer. And if they know the schedule in advance, they set a start and end time and the system handles it automatically. Works with your existing PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML stack. No website rebuild.\"\n\n**[Slide 10: How It Works + Price]**\n\n> \"The flow is simple. Your team gets a dashboard that covers all 8 to 10 HyperKidz websites. From there, they can do three things: manually add a popup to any site right now, manually remove a popup from any site right now, or schedule a popup with a start and end time and the system handles it automatically. No code, no developer, no FTP. Just pick the site, pick the message, and go.\n>\n> What you get: a single control panel for all HyperKidz locations, instant manual add and remove for any site, scheduled deployment and auto-removal when you want it hands-free, popup templates for common scenarios — private party, weather, closure — works on your existing PHP, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML stack, and any team member can use it without being a developer.\n>\n> Pricing: $1,000, one-time. That covers all 8 to 10 websites. Live within 2 weeks — I build it, deploy it, and train your team. Split payment — $500 upfront, $500 on delivery. Minimal tool costs after that — maybe $10 to $20 a month for hosting.\"\n\n**[Pause.]**\n\n> \"Questions about the popup system?\"\n\n---\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n**[Slide 11: All 3 Systems at a Glance]**\n\n> \"Here's all three side by side. Ad Intelligence: monitors your campaigns and competitors, $2,500 one-time. Lead Generation: finds prospects and books calls, $2,000 one-time or $500 a month managed. Website Automation: manage and schedule popups across all HyperKidz sites, $1,000.\n>\n> Each system is independent. You own everything I build. Even if we stop working together tomorrow, the systems stay yours.\"\n\n**[Slide 12: Closing]**\n\n> \"So that's it. Three systems. Each one solves a specific problem you told me about. Pick the one that matters most right now, or pick all three.\"\n\n---\n\n## STEP 4: CLOSE (10 minutes)\n\n### 4A: Open the Floor\n\n> \"What questions do you have?\"\n\n**Answer every question fully. Do not rush. Do not re-pitch.**\n\n### 4B: Get Alignment\n\n> \"Based on what you just saw — do any of these systems solve the problems you're dealing with right now?\"\n\n**You need a clear yes. If she's vague:**\n> \"Which one stood out to you most?\"\n\n### 4C: Ask for the Decision\n\n> \"So which system do you want to start with?\"\n\n**If she's leaning toward one, confirm and move forward:**\n> \"Let's do it. I'll send you the agreement today. Once signed, I start this week.\"\n\n**If she's interested in multiple:**\n> \"We can start all of them at once, or sequence them. What makes most sense for you right now?\"\n\n### 4D: Yes/No Frame (if she hesitates)\n\n> \"Shriya, I'm going to be straight with you. We've been talking since January. I've put real time into understanding your business and building out these systems. I want to work with you. But I need a clear answer today.\n>\n> Either one of these systems makes sense for where Stratgo Media is right now, or none of them do. Both answers are fine. But I can't do another round of 'let me think about it.' Can we keep it to a yes or a no?\"\n\n### 4E: If She Says Yes\n\n**To Ad Intelligence:**\n> \"Done. I'll send the agreement today. $1,250 upfront, $1,250 on delivery. Here's what I need from you to start: Meta Business Manager access for all locations, Google Ads access if applicable, your competitor list per location, and Google Workspace admin access for the report delivery. Can you get me that by end of this week?\"\n\n**To Lead Gen (One-Time):**\n> \"Done. I'll send the agreement today. $1,000 upfront, $1,000 on delivery. I'll need your ICP doc finalized, your Calendly or Cal.com link, and any testimonials or case materials you have ready. When do you want to kick this off?\"\n\n**To Lead Gen (Managed):**\n> \"Smart move. I'll send the agreement today. Same setup — I'll need ICP, calendar link, and any materials. Six-month commitment starts when we go live. First month is $500. When are you ready to launch — March?\"\n\n**To Website Automation:**\n> \"Done. I'll send the agreement today. $500 upfront, $500 on delivery. I'll need website credentials and hosting access for all HyperKidz locations so I can build the control panel across all 8 to 10 sites. Can you get me that this week?\"\n\n**To Multiple Systems:**\n> \"Let's lock them all in. I'll send one agreement covering everything. I can start all of them immediately. Sound good?\"\n\n### 4F: If She Needs to Talk to Co-Founder\n\n> \"I understand. What specific questions would they have? Is it the investment, the approach, or which system? Let me answer those now so you can bring them the full picture instead of a summary.\"\n\n### 4G: If She Says No\n\n> \"I respect that. Can I ask — is it the investment, the timing, or the approach? Just so I understand.\"\n\n**Thank her. Offer to reconnect in 60 days. Move on.**\n\n---\n\n## OBJECTION HANDLING\n\n### \"It's too expensive\"\n\n> \"Which system are you looking at? Let me put the number in context.\n>\n> For ad intelligence — you're already losing money every time a campaign goes unmonitored. You told me $100 wasted in just one incident. Over six months, those incidents cost more than $2,500. The system pays for itself in prevented waste.\n>\n> For lead gen — one new client pays you $3,000 a month minimum. One close covers the entire build plus months of tool costs. The ROI math isn't close.\n>\n> For the popup — one forgotten popup that costs a client a full day of revenue is $1,000 to $3,000 lost. Prevent that once and the system is paid for.\"\n\n### \"I want to start with just the popup — can we do that first?\"\n\n> \"Absolutely. That's why I built them as independent systems. $1,000 covers all 8 to 10 sites. $500 upfront, $500 on delivery. I just need website credentials and hosting access. Can you send that this week?\"\n\n### \"GoMarble does something similar for the ad part\"\n\n> \"GoMarble is built for D2C e-commerce brands running their own ads. It doesn't understand a multi-location franchise agency workflow — your client structure, your 30+ campaigns across different locations, your Google Workspace setup. What I'm building is designed around how Stratgo Media actually operates. It's not a generic SaaS tool. It's your system.\"\n\n### \"I need to talk to my co-founder first\"\n\n> \"Completely understand. What specifically would they want to know? Let me address those questions right now so you can present the full picture. Is it the money, what's included, or the approach?\"\n\n### \"Can we do $300/month for lead gen instead of $500?\"\n\n> \"At $300, I'd have to cut the outreach volume — fewer emails, fewer LinkedIn touches, slower pipeline. At $500, I can actually hit the channels properly. And remember — your ICP pays you $3,000 a month minimum. One closed client gives you a 6x return on a full year of lead gen. The $200 difference is what makes the system actually effective.\"\n\n### \"Let me think about it\"\n\n> \"What specifically do you need to think through? Is it the money, the approach, or which system to start with? Let's talk through whatever it is right now. You have me here, and I can answer anything. I don't want you to leave this call with unanswered questions.\"\n\n### \"I can't commit to all three right now\"\n\n> \"You don't have to. That's why they're independent. Pick the one that solves your biggest pain point today. We start there. The others are available whenever you're ready.\"\n\n### \"Can I DIY this / get it cheaper on Upwork?\"\n\n> \"You could get someone to build pieces of it. But you'd spend weeks specifying what you need, managing the developer, testing whether it actually works with your ad accounts and your website stack. I've already spent time understanding your workflow. I know your campaigns, your competitors, your client structure. You're not paying for code — you're paying for a system built around how your agency actually operates.\"\n\n---\n\n## POST-CALL ACTIONS\n\n**If she picks one or more systems:**\n1. Send agreement within 2 hours (specific to the system(s) chosen)\n2. Send WhatsApp checklist of what you need from her\n3. For Ad Intelligence: request Meta Business Manager, Google Ads, competitor lists, Google Workspace access\n4. For Lead Gen: request finalized ICP doc, calendar link, any testimonial materials\n5. For Website: request website credentials for code review, then follow up with final quote\n6. Start infrastructure setup same day\n\n**If she asks for time:**\n1. Send WhatsApp within 1 hour: summary of the 3 systems + prices\n2. Set a specific follow-up — 48 hours max, not open-ended\n3. Do NOT send the full proposal — that's your leverage\n\n**If she says no:**\n1. Thank her\n2. Offer to reconnect in 60 days\n3. Move on — do not chase\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL REMINDERS\n\n1. **Three independent systems, not a bundle.** Let her choose. Don't pressure all three.\n2. **Use her exact words throughout.** \"Bleed money,\" \"hiring folks for every five clients,\" \"heavily invested in operations,\" \"never got a chance to work on our own thing.\"\n3. **No revenue or conversion guarantees.** Be explicit: the systems deliver outputs (reports, booked calls, auto-removed popups). Results depend on her team's actions.\n4. **Her HyperKidz growth story is your anchor.** She took 3 locations to 10+. Reference it: \"You proved you can deliver. Now you need systems that scale with you.\"\n5. **Custom-built is your differentiator.** Not GoMarble. Not a SaaS tool. Not a generic Upwork build. This is built around her specific workflow.\n6. **Be direct on the close.** She has rescheduled multiple times and delayed info sharing. This call is the decision point. Respectful but firm.\n7. **Start with whatever she's ready for.** If she only wants the popup, take the popup. Get in the door. The other systems come later.\n8. **Pricing is firm.** Don't negotiate on the call. If she pushes, offer to split payments — not lower the price.\n","size":"21.6 KB","path":"Shriya/03_sales_script.md"},{"filename":"05_proposal.md","title":"Proposal","content":"# SERVICE PROPOSAL\n\n**Agency Intelligence Engine — Campaign Monitoring, Competitor Analysis & Website Automation**\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** Small Group\n**Prepared for:** Shriya Yerrabelly — Stratgo Media / Srinergy Global\n**Date:** February 25, 2026\n**Proposal valid until:** March 11, 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1.
