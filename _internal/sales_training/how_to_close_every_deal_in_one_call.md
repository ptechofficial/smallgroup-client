after thousands of sales calls and millions of dollars closed for imog godi I've realized the difference between a good closer and an elite closer boils down to two things the elite closers are not using Jedi Mind Tricks and more importantly they're not wasting their time in this video I am going to show you exactly why most sales training is backwards in the six-step framework that I use to close every single deal in one call there is one simple truth that most sales training doesn't teach the moment

00:00:31
you end a call without a decision is the moment that you lose the deal by the end of the sales training you will have the exact framework that I use to double my close rate and triple my monthly calls this is the guide that I wish I had when I first got into sales because trust me it was a struggle early on let's dive in the process starts way before you even hop on a call and what I'll do is share something that completely changed the way that I approach sales there was this guy Mike at my old company actually for

00:01:04
th nowin I was selling a real estate offer that was about $10,000 he was an absolute sales shark he showed up to every single call confidently but more than anything he was closing at above a 60% close rate I had to know his secret so one day I asked him Mike how do you show up to every single call but more than anything be so consistent month after month month what he told me changed everything and it sounds simple he told me Alex sales is just a reflection of your personal life when my personal life is going well it allows me

00:01:41
to come on calls confidently and close consistently when my personal life is [ __ ] it affects the quality of my sales calls this did Hit me hard because looking back at my sales slums at this point I was at year 4 of closing it wasn't necessarily that I needed more sales training when I went through sales slumps it was almost always because I wasn't staying true to myself outside of sales I wasn't keeping my own promises that were important to me I was skipping workouts I wasn't spending enough time

00:02:15
with my daughter here's what most people don't understand who you are on the call is who you are off the call you don't need another sales script you need to practice being a leader in your daily life put it this way you can't expect to lead other people to make a decision on a sales call if you can't even lead yourself find your north star commit to the things that you say you'll do become a better listener if you're not doing these things naturally you can't expect

00:02:43
to do it on calls it is funny as salespeople we spend so much time speaking with prospects getting them to commit to their own goals and to their own Vision but we can't even do it for ourselves prospects could smell the fakeness a mile away and the only way they will buy from you is if they see you as a leader but also an expert in your field this is why the best closers in the world are just really good leaders they are not trying to convince or manipulate they were just guiding you to make a decision whether it's yes or

00:03:12
no you've done your job now that you understand why being true to yourself outside of your sales calls is so important let's dive into the exact framework that I use to close deals consistently in one call and just wait till we get to step number six step number one if they are not ready get them off the call here is something that completely changed my perspective on calls hosi says this all the time the bigger the ask the longer the runway if you are selling something under $20,000 and it's taking you multiple calls

00:03:42
chances are you're doing something wrong I'll start with this when I joined iman's team he was a small Creator he wasn't nearly as big as he is now in fact I took a little bit of a risk uh leaving gym launch to join iman's team considering gym launch was a 100 $ million company and Iman was doing around 100K a month now once again at one point a couple months in Iman started blowing up his videos were going viral leads were pouring in and this was the interesting thing people would go

00:04:15
from watching One Singular video of Iman just finding out who he was to booking a call to purchase his product they had zero context zero preparation it was just pure excitement from what they saw I would spend 45 minutes on a sales call with these guys build great Rapport have a great conversation find a good pain Point pitch the product and what they would tell me was this Alex this sounds great your verbal pitch sounded beautiful but the thing is I just found out who Iman was yesterday and I don't

00:04:47
even have a visual representation of what all this looks like and it made sense how could you buy something for thousands of dollars without having a true visual representation on what it is that you're buying and this Tom me something crucial calendar slots are precious listen every call that you take with someone who isn't well informed on the offer or product that you're selling is a wasted time slot that you could have had with a good lead most reps are so desperate for calls that they will

00:05:14
take a sales call with anybody that has a pulse without proper qualifications bad reps are not good reps think of it this way you know let's imagine you play soccer or football depending on what you call it and you are practicing taking shots at a goalpost that is twice the size is that really worth your time or are you just taking fake practice shots so next time you take a sales call make sure your lead is qualified here's what I do differently first thing I do on every single call is make sure the

00:05:45
prospect watches the preall preparation video and if they don't I will kindly let them know hey let's have you watch this first and then we could have a conversation an hour from now if you need an exact script this is what I say listen man I love that you jumped in let's spend the next 5 to 10 minutes answering some questions that you have and then what we could do let's have you watch that video first it'll give you a good visual representation on everything we're about to talk about and then we

00:06:12
can meet later today at 300 p.m. would that work now after making sure that the prospect watches the pre-call prep video I will also pre-qualify any red flags for example let's imagine I get somebody that looks rather Young on a call I will ask their age if they are 20 I will see if they need their parents on the call versus if I get a wife who mentions hey I have a husband I will kindly ask them what does your husband think about you moving forward and making this type of decision today if they tell me Alex I'm

00:06:44
going to have to talk to my husband after this to make sure he's okay with it I will reschedule the meeting with the wife and the husband why would I waste my time on a 45 minute to a 1-hour conversation when I could reschedule them with the proper people on the call that way I could spend that hour dialing leads and setting High qualified appointments to my calendar I just saved my time and put myself in a position to make more money the key is identify these red flags early in the conversation rather than hearing them

00:07:15
come up at minute 45 or minute 50 as an objection once again spend that free hour dialing leads and setting high quality appointments for yourself or even do followup now step two is setting the frame the first five minutes of your sales call determines everything it's what sets you as the authority with the conversation but also shows your expertise what you're doing when you're setting frame is laying out the agenda for the conversation and this is the exact framework that I use beautiful so

00:07:47
we have about 45 minutes here just so you know I have done these calls hundreds of times the main gist of them I'm just going to ask you a couple questions just to see where you are now but also where you want to go and as long as we could help I'll be the first person to tell you I'll give you a good Breakdown Cover any questions you have and as long as you like what you hear we'll get you ready to rock by the end of the call is that cool this Frame Works perfectly for three reasons number

00:08:12
one you are laying out clear expectations of how the sales call will go number two is you are framing yourself as an expert by letting them know hey I've done these calls hundreds of times and number three you are laying the foundations of the clothes by letting them know hey as long as you like what you hear here we are going to get you started at the end of this call most reps either skip setting frame or they make it feel like a salesy corporate presentation and both will kill your closeth rate sales is a roller

00:08:43
coaster this is the exact way that you need to conduct the discovery section of your sales call I kid you not making this one small change in my fourth year of sales took me from a 30% close rate to a nearly 60% close rate on tha's offer I mentioned this earlier I was selling an offer a real estate offer that was nearly $10,000 and on that offer I was speaking with Rich prospects people who had a lot of money this roller coaster frame is the complete different way of what gym launch taught me on how to sell most reps do this

00:09:16
backwards they start Discovery with current state struggles and end Discovery with future State goals let's imagine you are selling a fitness offer a offer that helps people lose weight side note if you're selling a fitness offer you've probably seen this before they are notorious for having prospects that cry on the sales call and reason being it's kind of logical you know sometimes you're dealing with someone that's 100 lb overweight their husband or their wife is thinking about leaving

00:09:43
them or maybe they're having health issues now with the framework that gym launch taught me starting out current state struggles and ending at Future State goals when you're talking about their struggles they may start crying at the start of the discovery section and then you're essentially telling them hey wipe your tears let's talk about your future State goals if you flip it and use the roller coaster analogy you are going to start the conversation with their future State goals and you are

00:10:11
going to end the conversation with their current state struggles essentially if you have a crier on this Fitness offer they will cry at the end of Discovery and then you will tell them hey wipe your tears Let Me Pitch our offer and explain how we're going to get you to that Big Goal it's a complete game Game Changer so utilize this on your sales call my framework is super simple you start with an overview of why we're here on the call you take it straight to Future State goals and you end the call

00:10:41
with their current state struggles that way you could use the pitch as your solution that brings them back to that heighten sense of emotion this is what puts you in the position to be one of the best closers in the industry we the best closers they don't get objections they just get questions step number four it's either a [ __ ] yes or a [ __ ] no listen I am sure that you have been on a sales call before where you get the dreaded I need to think about it it's quite interesting if you don't want to

00:11:12
hear I need to think about it you know what would be smart to tell the prospect that you don't want to hear you need to think about it now once you get permission to proceed and get into the pitch this is what you need to tell your prospect it's called the yes no or maybe frame and Paul da shout out to you you did show me how to structure this when I was receiving a lot of I need to think about it so next time you pitch say this hey Mr Prospect we could totally help you with XYZ problem and I would love to

00:11:43
break down how we're going to help you get to XYZ goal that they told you they had once they say Okay 100% that is permission to proceed now you get into the yes no or maybe frame and essentially this is what you need to tell them beautiful now by the way at the end of the call I know there is typically three things you could say either Alex hell yes let's do this no which I want you to know I am 100% okay with a no the one I do want to avoid is the uh let me think about it let me talk to my dog about it because you know we

00:12:16
both know that is usually a nice way of saying no so is it okay to keep it between either a yes or a no this is how you kindly let the prospect know hey I don't want to hear I need to think about it and you will be so surprised how many calls I've got gotten to the very end and they say Alex I really wanted to think about it but you know you told me you want a yes or no and this feels right so let's do it the yes no or maybe Frame Works but it won't save your sales call so you need to build a clear Gap in

00:12:45
the discovery section of your call which is why you use the roller coaster method step number five the three-pillar pitch here's something I learned from or cloth people understand things better in Pillars of three don't try to over complicate your pitch by reading the Declaration of Independence and for each pillar I use the PFS framework meaning problem using the exact problem that the prospects stated they had feature meaning the feature of our product that will solve that problem and solution

00:13:15
saying their desired outcome here's an example hey Mr Prospect you remember how you told me that you couldn't get enough leads for your business what we are going to do is run all of your marketing for you by running Facebook and Google ads that will provide an abundance of leads to your company and what that is going to do for you is put you in the position where you never dry on leads ever again problem feature solution and side note with that it is crucial to use the prospect's exact language in your

00:13:45
pitch if they told you that they need more leads then don't have the first pillar of your pitch be about team building they will buy based off what they feel like they need help with not what you assume they need help with step number six assume the close after you've pitched your product use this four-step framework to get the deal closed and accept payment the key with this is to have great pace and slow yourself down when it comes to pitching the price and accepting payment a lot of sales reps

00:14:16
rush through this process and what it does is scares the prospect from buying even if you had a great call so you need to slow yourself down take it slow and come from a place of understanding this is the easiest part of your sales call to become salesy and once again you could have a 10 out of 10 perfect call but if you speedrun the process of closing the prospect after pitching you will lose a deal now here is the four-step framework number one is exhaust all questions what that means is we do not want to pitch the price until

00:14:50
every single question that the prospect has about the product is answered last thing we want to do is say hey this is $10,000 and then the prospect starts asking asking you a million questions about the ins and outs of the product so exhaust all questions as soon as you pitch your product end it with hey what questions do you have answer every single question until they get to the point of saying uh yeah Alex I actually don't have any other questions from there Step number two is get alignment

00:15:20
the key with getting alignment is you need to bring up hey do you feel like this will help you get to XYZ goal that you told me you have remind the prospect that this isn't about buying a cool product it's about buying something that will solve their problems and reach their goals so the exact words that I say when I want to get alignment is beautiful awesome I'm glad you have no other questions let me ask you this how do you feel on our product getting you to XYZ goal you need a hell yes if not

00:15:52
if they give you some type of wishy-washy answer as in uh I I think so it might hit them with a Y make them explain themselves and sell them down the path of hey this is why I think your product will get us to our goal after getting alignment you move to step three which is price dropping now whenever I price drop I love to Value stack on top of the price meaning if you just say hey this is $10,000 it hits a hell of a lot harder compared to saying awesome so for everything included to get you to your

00:16:24
XYZ goal the coaching the program as a whole us holding your handre throughout the process and everything included it'll be $10,000 value stack obviously I Rift what's included with that product but based off what's in your offer stack that on top of the pitch before you drop the price remind them of what's included and how much value they're getting for the price point of your offer the key with dropping price is as soon as you say how much it costs sit in silence the first one to speak loses gym launch

00:16:59
taught this so shout out to Alex Heros the first one to speak loses sit in silence now this is when we get to step four assume the [ __ ] clothes once the prospect says um okay let them know awesome next steps are simple let's get you logged in let's get you scheduled for your next call and then you will be ready to rock is that cool this is when either objections will come up or the prospect will follow along with you and get onboarded and give you their credit card but this is also the

00:17:30
point where prospects may give you objections but I have learned the best closers don't get objections they just get questions but if you want me to make a video on how to master every single objection comment below I will say this 99% of the time if you receive an objection at the end of the call it's because you didn't ask good enough questions during Discovery this is why the roller coaster method will help you so much it will build that Gap and put the prospect in a position where they

00:17:59
need your product you are not trying to sell it now you understand how to close a deal with just one conversation but knowing it is half the battle you need to see it in action the real challenge is understanding how to implement it in a real life conversation without sounding salesy or pushy that's why I want you to watch my next video which will be tagged below uh where I show you a live call recording of Me closing a deal for imong godi using this exact framework and if you're serious about
