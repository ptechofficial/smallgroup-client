## LEARNINGS LOG

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Structure

**Context:** Shriya had 3 independent needs (ad monitoring, lead gen, website automation). Initial approach was to bundle all 3 as "pillars" of one "Agency Intelligence Engine" with one bundled price.

**What changed:** User requested 3 separate systems, each with its own pricing. Each system presented independently: what it is, how it works, what you get, what it costs.

**Why it's better:**
- Client can pick one, two, or all three — lowers the barrier to "yes"
- Budget-conscious clients ($10k/mo revenue) feel less pressured when they can start small
- Each system has a clear, justified price rather than one large number
- "Pick the one that matters most" is a more natural close than "choose option 1 or 2 of a bundle"

**Rule:** When a client has 2+ genuinely independent problems, default to multi-system pitch. Only bundle when the problems are parts of the same workflow.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Positioning

**Context:** No existing proof/case study for ad monitoring or website automation. The standard playbook calls for a "we already built this" proof drop (3x in the script).

**What changed:** Replaced proof drop with "Custom-Built Positioning" — the differentiator becomes "I'm building this specifically for your workflow" rather than "we already built this for someone else."

**Why it works:**
- Clients who value control and ownership respond well to "built for YOU"
- When a competitor tool exists (GoMarble in this case), custom-built positioning directly counters "why not just use the SaaS tool?"
- Authenticity matters — don't fake a proof drop. If you haven't built it, say "I will build exactly what you need."

**Rule:** Proof Drop and Custom-Built Positioning are two valid strategies. Use whichever is honest. Never fake proof.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Pricing

**Context:** Standard pricing guidelines show Lead Gen at $3,000-5,000 one-time or $1,500-2,000/mo managed. Shriya's budget was $2.5k max one-time and $300/mo.

**What changed:** Priced Lead Gen at $1,000 one-time / $500/mo managed (reduced from initial $2,000 — see 2026-02-24 entry). Ad Intelligence at $2,500 one-time. Website at "starting at $500."

**Why:**
- Client revenue is $10k/mo. Standard pricing ($5k+) would be 50% of monthly revenue — unreasonable.
- Price should match both the VALUE delivered and the client's ability to pay.
- "Starting at $X" is valid when final pricing depends on reviewing existing infrastructure (code, ad accounts, etc.)

**Rule:** Pricing guidelines are baselines, not mandates. Adjust to the client's revenue, budget reality, and deal size. A client paying $2,500 today can become a $2,000/mo client in 6 months.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Templates

**Context:** Standard pitch deck template (13 slides) is designed for single-system pitches with pillars. Doesn't work well for multi-system.

**What changed:** Created a new pitch deck structure for multi-system:
- Slide 1: Title ("3 Systems to Scale [Company]")
- Slide 2: Overview cards (all systems at a glance)
- Per system: What & Why → How It Works (flow) → What You Get + Price
- Summary table (all systems side-by-side)
- Close ("pick the one that matters most")

**Key design decisions:**
- Each system gets a color-coded section divider (blue/green/orange) for visual clarity
- "How It Works" uses flow diagrams (`.flow-step` + `.flow-arrow`) — not just feature descriptions
- Include concrete examples (e.g., "CTR high + Conversions low → Landing page issue")
- Summary slide uses a comparison table, not stat cards
- "System outputs — not revenue guarantees" explicit on every pricing card

**Rule:** Two deck structures exist now. Use single-system (13-slide) for one-problem clients. Use multi-system (12-slide) for multi-problem clients.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — No Outcome Guarantees

**Context:** Earlier pitches (Ernest, Joseph) included "Projected Results" slides with specific numbers (e.g., "2,000-2,500 contacts/month", "20-30 articles/week").

**What changed:** For Shriya, removed all projected business outcome numbers. Instead, stated what each system OUTPUTS: daily reports, booked calls, auto-removed popups. Explicitly noted: "System outputs — not revenue guarantees."

**Why:**
- User was clear: "I can't guarantee revenue for them, or conversion rate for them"
- This is more honest and protects us from unrealistic expectations
- Focus on WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES, not what the client's business results might be

**Rule:** Always be explicit about what the system delivers vs. what depends on the client. Use "system outputs" language. It's OK to show output volume (emails sent, campaigns monitored) but NOT business outcomes (revenue increase, conversion rate improvement).

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Close Strategy

**Context:** Standard close is "option 1 or option 2" for a single system. Multi-system requires a different approach.

**What changed:** Multi-system close is "Which system do you want to start with?" with system-specific next steps for each answer.

**Key insight:** When a client has been going back and forth (rescheduling, delaying), the Yes/No frame should be firmer: "We've been talking since [month]. I've put real time into this. I need a clear answer today." Not aggressive — but direct.

**Rule:** For multi-system, the close is "which one?" not "yes or no to the bundle." Different next steps for each system they choose.

---

### 2026-02-24 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Pricing

**Context:** Lead Gen system was initially priced at $2,000 one-time. User decided to reduce it to $1,000 one-time before the pitch call.

**What changed:** Lead Gen one-time build price dropped from $2,000 to $1,000. Split payment updated accordingly ($500 upfront / $500 on delivery). Managed option stays at $500/mo.

**Why:** Further adjustment to match client's budget reality and lower the barrier to entry. At $1,000, the ROI math is even more compelling — one closed client at $3,000/mo covers the build 3x over.

**Rule:** Don't be afraid to price aggressively for the first deal with a client. Getting in the door matters more than maximizing the first invoice. The managed option and future systems are where long-term revenue comes from.
