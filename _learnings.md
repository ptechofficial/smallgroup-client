## LEARNINGS LOG

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Structure

**Context:** Shriya had 3 independent needs (ad monitoring, lead gen, website automation). Initial approach was to bundle all 3 as "pillars" of one "Agency Intelligence Engine" with one bundled price.

**What changed:** User requested 3 separate systems, each with its own pricing. Each system presented independently: what it is, how it works, what you get, what it costs.

**Why it's better:**
- Client can pick one, two, or all three — lowers the barrier to "yes"
- Budget-conscious clients ($10k/mo revenue) feel less pressured when they can start small
- Each system has a clear, justified price rather than one large number
- "Pick the one that matters most" is a more natural close than "choose option 1 or 2 of a bundle"

**Rule:** When a client has 2+ genuinely independent problems, default to multi-system pitch. Only bundle when the problems are parts of the same workflow.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Positioning

**Context:** No existing proof/case study for ad monitoring or website automation. The standard playbook calls for a "we already built this" proof drop (3x in the script).

**What changed:** Replaced proof drop with "Custom-Built Positioning" — the differentiator becomes "I'm building this specifically for your workflow" rather than "we already built this for someone else."

**Why it works:**
- Clients who value control and ownership respond well to "built for YOU"
- When a competitor tool exists (GoMarble in this case), custom-built positioning directly counters "why not just use the SaaS tool?"
- Authenticity matters — don't fake a proof drop. If you haven't built it, say "I will build exactly what you need."

**Rule:** Proof Drop and Custom-Built Positioning are two valid strategies. Use whichever is honest. Never fake proof.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Pricing

**Context:** Standard pricing guidelines show Lead Gen at $3,000-5,000 one-time or $1,500-2,000/mo managed. Shriya's budget was $2.5k max one-time and $300/mo.

**What changed:** Priced Lead Gen at $2,000 one-time / $500/mo managed. Ad Intelligence at $2,500 one-time. Website Popup at $1,000 one-time (covers all 8-10 HyperKidz sites).

**Why:**
- Client revenue is $10k/mo. Standard pricing ($5k+) would be 50% of monthly revenue — unreasonable.
- Price should match both the VALUE delivered and the client's ability to pay.
- "Starting at $X" is valid when final pricing depends on reviewing existing infrastructure (code, ad accounts, etc.)

**Rule:** Pricing guidelines are baselines, not mandates. Adjust to the client's revenue, budget reality, and deal size. A client paying $2,500 today can become a $2,000/mo client in 6 months.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Templates

**Context:** Standard pitch deck template (13 slides) is designed for single-system pitches with pillars. Doesn't work well for multi-system.

**What changed:** Created a new pitch deck structure for multi-system:
- Slide 1: Title ("3 Systems to Scale [Company]")
- Slide 2: Overview cards (all systems at a glance)
- Per system: What & Why → How It Works (flow) → What You Get + Price
- Summary table (all systems side-by-side)
- Close ("pick the one that matters most")

**Key design decisions:**
- Each system gets a color-coded section divider (blue/green/orange) for visual clarity
- "How It Works" uses flow diagrams (`.flow-step` + `.flow-arrow`) — not just feature descriptions
- Include concrete examples (e.g., "CTR high + Conversions low → Landing page issue")
- Summary slide uses a comparison table, not stat cards
- "System outputs — not revenue guarantees" explicit on every pricing card

**Rule:** Two deck structures exist now. Use single-system (13-slide) for one-problem clients. Use multi-system (12-slide) for multi-problem clients.

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — No Outcome Guarantees

**Context:** Earlier pitches (Ernest, Joseph) included "Projected Results" slides with specific numbers (e.g., "2,000-2,500 contacts/month", "20-30 articles/week").

**What changed:** For Shriya, removed all projected business outcome numbers. Instead, stated what each system OUTPUTS: daily reports, booked calls, auto-removed popups. Explicitly noted: "System outputs — not revenue guarantees."

**Why:**
- User was clear: "I can't guarantee revenue for them, or conversion rate for them"
- This is more honest and protects us from unrealistic expectations
- Focus on WHAT THE SYSTEM DOES, not what the client's business results might be

**Rule:** Always be explicit about what the system delivers vs. what depends on the client. Use "system outputs" language. It's OK to show output volume (emails sent, campaigns monitored) but NOT business outcomes (revenue increase, conversion rate improvement).

### 2026-02-23 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Close Strategy

**Context:** Standard close is "option 1 or option 2" for a single system. Multi-system requires a different approach.

**What changed:** Multi-system close is "Which system do you want to start with?" with system-specific next steps for each answer.

**Key insight:** When a client has been going back and forth (rescheduling, delaying), the Yes/No frame should be firmer: "We've been talking since [month]. I've put real time into this. I need a clear answer today." Not aggressive — but direct.

**Rule:** For multi-system, the close is "which one?" not "yes or no to the bundle." Different next steps for each system they choose.

### 2026-02-25 — Shriya (Stratgo Media) — Pricing / Scope

**Context:** Website Popup system was initially priced at "starting at $500" with a "final quote after code review" caveat. After more clarity on the scope (8-10 HyperKidz websites, manual add/remove + scheduling), user set a firm price of $1,000.

**What changed:** Website Popup priced at $1,000 one-time (covers all 8-10 sites). No longer "starting at" — firm price. Scope expanded: users can manually add/remove popups instantly OR schedule with auto-deploy and auto-remove. Single control panel for all sites.

**Why:** With clearer scope (exact number of sites, exact functionality needed), a firm price is better than "starting at." $1,000 for 8-10 sites is ~$100-125 per site — reasonable for the client and profitable for us.

**Rule:** Once scope is clear, convert "starting at $X" to a firm price. Ambiguous pricing creates friction at close. Firm numbers close faster.

### 2026-02-27 — Joseph Cyriac — Pricing / Negotiation

**Context:** Original pitch was $1,500/mo managed (6-month commitment) with aggressive volume: 500-1,000 leads/week sourced, 100 LinkedIn connections/week, 350-450 cold emails/day. Joseph came back 2 weeks later at $900/mo, asked to dial down volume, and wanted no minimum contract.

**What changed:** Accepted $900/mo with reduced scope — 100 LinkedIn connections/week, 50 DMs/week, 200 cold emails/week (~1,400 monthly touchpoints vs. original 3,000+). No minimum contract, month-to-month with advance payment. System live in 1 week instead of 4.

**Why:** Joseph is bootstrapping, funding tools out of pocket, and price-sensitive. Getting him in at $900/mo with room to scale up is better than losing the deal entirely. Lower volume also means lower tool costs for him and lower operational load for us.

**Rule:** When a client negotiates down, reduce scope proportionally rather than discounting the same work. "Start simple, scale later" is a valid sales motion — especially for bootstrapping founders. Month-to-month with advance payment reduces risk for both sides.
